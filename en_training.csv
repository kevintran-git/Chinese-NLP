"Well yes I do. There were many who lived under Nazi occupation who strongly supported Joe Stalin. In Occupied Holland for example it was the communists who organised the hiding and escape of Jews.  In Britain in 1941 ""Uncle Joe"" would have come third in a popularity contest behind Churchill and King George VI and ahead of Roosevelt, who said nice things but hadn't actually provided any troops yet. And of course there were millions of decent men and women in the 1920s and 30s who looked to communism as a better way than the economic system they had to live under. So a blanket kneejerk condemnation is simplistic.     Nice try Grant, but that was not the question asked. So -  ""You will readily denounce Pinochet, Somoza the Shah of Iran - to name but three? And those who supported them?""  As to democracy, we can discuss what democracy means after you've cleared up this little matter.",2,-2

Do you think that if jews said we want to all live in Saudi Arabia so we want it to change its stauts as a muslim state and become a democratic one for all after all the jews are living in the same part of the world are they not  Just because your naighbor wants something and is using violence to try and get it you should change your national identity to keep the enemy happy either the enemy is willing to accept reality using diplomacy or they want to use violence so you use violence back and crush them but you dont just say I give up I am going to give up my identity so you can be happy.  The arabs can give up terror, accept the only option avalible is 2 states BASED ( not exactly )  on the 1949 ceacefire borders but if they use terror they dont get 2 states and they dont get Israel to agree to give up its status as a jewish state.  No organistion like the UN or country US included can make Israel change its stauts its never going to be anything but an arab fantasy",1,-2

"The Nazi's didn't even want Jews as a workforce ... during a war. They wanted ALL Jews dead.  Quite frankly I doubt you've ever been to the South because your comments show a lot of ignorance about the region. Now if a white person brutally murders a person of any race in any state in the South they are prosecuted and usually sentenced to death  Not usually by any means the number of blacks as opposed to whites sentenced to death even for the same crimes is disproportionate.  Whenever a shortcomingof the US is ever pointed out its appeasers and defenders always try and justify it by some idiotic reference to conditions in Kazakhstan or outer Mongolia, as if that is the moral compass.  And of course Kazahkstan etc do not claim to be paradises of tolerance and human rights.  In this case  the fact the pupil felt he had to ask permission to sit under a certain tree in his own country is appalling enough.  One wonders what similar incidents go unreported.

"About the emigration of Jewish people from Europe to British mandated Palestine after WW2.  It was British policy to restrict that emigration, and some 49 ships carrying 66,000 Jewish people were boarded by the Royal Navy, and the passengers taken to internment camps on Cyprus.  <a href=""http://www.britains-smallwars.com/Palestine/rn.htm"">www.britains-smallwa...</a>",1,-2
"Grant,  The point is I haven't had an answer. You declined to talk about the Spanish civil war when I hadn't even asked you to. I asked you to comment on the US entering into a military alliance with fascist Spain in the early 50s.   In fact in summarising our debate over Mc Carthyism it is clear that your argument is hypocritical and full of holes.   You've made a statement along the lines of, 'we should be vigilant against fascism and communism'. Well the US govt. certainly wasn't. I've already pointed that the the US admin. worked with fascists in Greece, Italy and Spain(as well as a host of murderous dictatorial regimes across the globe). Yet you build an argument around the need to protect 'freedom'. This is utterly hypocritical.   The US , during the Mc Carthy period was hounding people they believed were communists, or used to be, or knew somebody who was, or thought they knew somebody or was etc etc. all in the name of 'freedom'.  But who were the kind of people being hounded? I would never join the CP but am more than aware of how many of their members have rallied to progressiove causes. In Britain who was it who stood in the front line when the British Union of Fascists tried to drive out the Jews? The CP. And who was it who fought against and suffered under the Nazis in Germany?  And what would Nelson Mandela say? Imprisoned for 27 years, who was it in the front line against the vile Apartheid regime? The CP. Whilst the US on the other hand were happy to work with the regime in  the military conflict in Angola.  The truth is Mc Carthyism has nothing to do with preventing mass murder by Stalinism and everything to do with denying freedom in the US itself. You say you are for trade union freedom but Mc Carthyism amounted to hounding union officials out of jobs and sacking people for not signing 'loyalty oaths'. The kind of unionism you favour is compliant unionism , the tame variety that does fight for members interests.   This is what Mc Carthyism was all about. Talking about freedom whilst dealing with fascists. Hounding people who the most likely to rally for freedom of black people in the USA and South Africa.    A final point about Islam. Again you spout hypocrisy on this issue. For years the US has used Saudi Arabia as a client state in its dealings in the oil rich Middle East. Yet this alliance has spawned the likes of Bin Laden , the irony is presumably lost on you.   So let's have no more of this hypocritical posturing on the need to fight for freedom.",1,-4

"The people are not interested in education?  That's what I would expect someone who 'thinks' a religion is a substitute for an 'education' would say.  It is not, and it never has been. This is an identity that your country hasn't even been able to deduce for itself, so again colonelartist, you are just over projecting too.  Let's just assume you are right, and these poor little country bumpkins have no ambitions in life beyond their stations as peasants (abhorrent and wrong - but an assumption none the less). This is dear to you, the thought of simplicity, the thought of 'nothing do.....ing', and the thought of not having opportunities presented and within arms reach of people.  You would force them onto this path, you would keep them on it, warning them of the dangers that await them should they be tempted by Satan and all his devices (like I said, religion isn't an education). FINE! Have it your way.  But we'll STILL build that road. We'll STILL build that school, and we'll STILL pipe in that water and deliver sanitation. And when it's within arms reach - they'll take that road whether you like it or not colonelartist.  You did, and you probably rail at that personal choice you made in your live (feeling it's a dishonour to your simple view of Islam). But don't presume that others share your spirits or tempers.  Quite simply - you can't stop it. More and More and More Educated Women are coming to wider Islam, and More and More and More of them will be offered the chances to stop acting like the ""oppressed"". And when those coins begin to drop everywhere, the grip of religious extremism is loosened never to return to total control and domination, which is all it's really concerned about anyway.

"&lt;&lt;  When you talk about the Jews having been 'kicked out' of Israel, are you talking about ancient history? Because it is mad! Before the Jews were there, somebody else was there and so on, back into the mists of time.&gt;&gt;  These people who were there before the Jews , who were they ? ,  where are they now ?.And what evidence do can you adduce  to support  the claims of whosoever you bring forward in support of your  argument ?.  &lt;&lt; Once again, do you have the same theories about every piece of land? Who is the true owner of England; Saxon? Dane? Celt? (This is very bad news for most of the people who think they are citizens of a country like the USA)  &gt;&gt;  What are my 'theories about every piece of land ' ?. I am talking about People.  People have connections with with geographic regions.    &lt;&lt; I thought you were saying that as long as you could keep Palestinians off their land until the first generation were all dead then that would make their dispossession acceptable. I do not think that is the right way to treat anyone; Armenian, Jew or Palestinian.&gt;&gt;  It would help if you  read what I actually wrote and then consequent upon digestion thereof  you responded with your opinion. I pointed out that MOST  'Palestinians'  who were alive in 1947 are now no longer alive. Even if they were born in 1947 they would now be 61. The vast majority of the Palestinians were born post 1947. This is a simple fact. So now , on what basis do you advance the notion that they have the right to go and live in the State of  Israel ?. Pay close attention to the last  three words. State of Israel. Nine Syllables.Concatenate . Aspirate.Appreciate.   &lt;&lt; First of all nowhere did I say that if you can displace 'a population' for long enough then it does not matter , and I challenge you to either point where i said as much or withdrw that remark.. &gt;&gt;  You then go on to quote  two paragraphs from my previous post that do not in any way substantiate or even speak to the idea that 'it does not matter'. In fact if you go back and read my posts you will  find that I  am sympathetic to  Palestinian aspirations towards Statehood.  &lt;&lt; I do not know why I am finding it so hard to explain that I find all this talk of who is or isn't a 'people' both absurd and sinister. We should treat people as individuals - when considering the right way to treat a fellow British person is I do not first need to find out if they are a Jew! Similarly, states have a duty to displaced persons; their 'people' is irrelevant. &gt;&gt;  And I on the other hand am quite astonished at your 'difficulty'.It seem to me that you are taking great pains to deny the existence of the fundamental anthropological imperative to form cultures. Yes of course we should and  do treat people as individuals.But  your next statement is at once  problematic yet informative. And belies a smidgeon of  arrogance on your part. You have a world view.It is your world view.If you do NOT consider the individual  as he has SELF DEFINED himself  you have abrogated to ourself the right to impose a world view upon him because without consideration to the way he has self defined himself all mutual interaction has to be based upon your world view. I love pork crackling. They are cheap  and the after taste hangs around for longer than a packet of crisps .I always have some on me.I  never offer them to my son's Somali team-mate. And condiderate Englishmen don't indulge in conversations centred around the derring-do of British bomber pilots in front of Germans. I would hope that you transact with other people with a bit more sensitivity.         &lt;&lt; So your difference with the BNP is that they are interested in 'race' and you are interested in something called 'self-identity' &gt;&gt;  I am not 'interested' in self identity. It exists.It is.    &lt;&lt;  Actually, the mainstream BNP tend to use your approach these days. They deny their dislike of immigrants is about racism - it is all about 'shared values' and 'Britishness'. &gt;&gt;  The BNP can use whatever disengenous 'approach' they like to camouflage the fact that their ideals are racist. However 'shared values' and 'Britishness' are quite correctly mainstream concepts and are incorporated into both Labour and  Conservative party policies.    &lt;&lt; No, it's not up to them. It is up to all of us to fight against that sort of behaviour.&gt;.  Again , you arrogant slip is showing. On what basis do you abrogate to yourself the right to decide how others view themselves , their history , their heritage , their norms and  who others wish or do not wish to associate with. I am quite franjly astonished at your arrogance. Would you then take issue with Nelson Mandela  then when he offered Afrikaaners the option of constitutionally negotiating for an Afrikaaner homeland. ?   &lt;&lt; You are free to associate for your mutual benefit but only up to the point where it infringes on the rights of other groups to equal treatment. Do I really need to tell you this? &gt;&gt;  No what you do need to do is explain yourself. Freedom of association is just that.Freedom of Association.   Hotmousemat I really think that you need to step back and think about all of the contradictions in your arguments. Just by way of  example :-- 1. You tell me that you have great difficulty in underestanding the notion of  'a people'.2. Then in one of your other posts , unrelated to our discussion , you write ""&lt;&lt; But when we see A PEOPLE  behaving in a way that seems unreasonable it is as well to try to understand how it may seem from their point of view. &gt;&gt; ( My caps ).

"Mondial, the tragedy of Iraq is that the majority of the killing of people is done by fellow Iraqis, not the US/UK occupiers. Much was made of the shock and awe bombing campaign.

Fellow Iraqis are bombing markets, football celebrations, mosques, etc., all deliberate civilian killing.   Please don't believe I supported this invasion for one minute.  It was a disaster and unnecessary from the beginning.    With that said, Iraq pales in comparison to the 'genocide' in Sudan. Is it that the US/UK are involved that makes it worse to some?

"///Several inventors, scientists, and engineers contributed to the development of radar. The use of radio waves to detect ""the presence of distant metallic objects via radio waves"" was first implemented in 1904 by Christian Hülsmeyer,[2][3] who demonstrated the feasibility of detecting the presence of a ship in dense fog, but not its distance. He received a Reichspatent patent Nr. 165546 for his pre-radar device in April and on November 11, 1904 the patent 169154 an amendment of his patent for ranging that is indirectly related to his device. He received a patent (GB13170) in England for his telemobiloscope on September 22 1904.[2][4]  Prior to the Second World War, developments by the Americans (Dr. Robert M. Page tested the first monopulse radar in 1934),[5] the Germans, the French (French Patent n° 788795 in 1934),[6] and the British (British Patent GB593017 by Robert Watson-Watt in 1935),[6][7] led to the first real radars. Hungarian Zoltán Bay produced a working model by 1936 at the Tungsram laboratory in the same vein////  Ok, but it was a German who invented the concept, from which the Americans came next, then the French, then Germans again, then Brits derived modern radar.",1,-2

"Ruth,  OK, what I’m going to do this time is spell out my argument and supporting evidence as simply as I can. America invaded Iraq to control its oil. You ask “WHY do you think they want to control Iraqi oil?” Well, the answer is that oil is very useful to America. Why is it very useful to America? Read this article: <a href=""http://www.energybulletin.net/4287.html"">www.energybulletin.n...</a>.   In a previous post, you asked “please explain when you think we'll start balancing the scales against those billions already spent and the billions more to come.” I pointed out that you were assuming I thought America would “balance the scales” at all. Now you claim not to have made this assumption, but I'm afraid you did. It’s there in black and white. How am I supposed to answer a question based on a false assumption? I don’t know whether the American investment in Iraq will bear dividends. I don’t think the Americans do, either.  “If [the motive is] money…at least explain why you think the US government would think it would be profitable.”  I’ve had to cut out large chunks of your post to find this question, but I think it’s what you’re getting at. Why did the US think it would be profitable? Well, in my opinion they had a much shorter war in mind. They wanted to fight a quick war with a small army, gain control of Iraq, install military bases and a compliant “puppet government,” then leave.   You’ll notice that I am not replying any more on the Canada question. This is because I don’t think it merits any further response. If you really want me to write another post explaining in ever-increasing detail my reasons for believing that America will not invade Canada, I’ll be happy to do so.

Jews are not the only group of people who have lived apart from their neighbours, or who have been driven from their original lands.

And additionally you have  the expat communities of bankers and traders, Lombards, Venetians, Netherlanders, even Scots. They've left their traces in family names in odd places, street names, churches and houses. Historically all have been shunned and persecuted from time to time. Historically too all have eventually assimilated into their host community through inter-marriage and such. Except the Roma, whose wandering life style rather precludes assimilation.

Mr Galloway was part of a convoy which delivered financial and material assistance to Gaza through the Rafah crossing with Egypt on Wednesday.

Anyway I'm not trying to argue that the WSJ is a shabby rag, I quite agree that it has a solid professional reputation. I'm merely pointing out that it represents only one strand of opinion.     Actually yes, or at least it was heading that way. Europe was in the process of recovering from WW2 and withdrawing from its various empires. Europe's R&amp;D was falling behind the Soviets, never mind the Americans and Europe's economies were stagnant. Back in the 1950's the Deutschmark was mickey mouse money and the French franc traded at 1000's to the dollar. And the British pound was part way through a long decline.     No, but a Europe of mutually suspicious nations that can be played off against each other might suit. Not so suspicious that another war was a possibility but certainly the WSJ would approve of a Europe where the various nations competed in lowering taxes and regulations on business. Business always likes governments to engage in a race to the bottom on workers rights, environmental protection and corporate taxation.  (If you think states should race to the bottom like that then maybe you should do the decent thing and tell us why you think workers should have little or no job security, why polluters should get away scot free and why the burden of taxation should fall disproportionately on the middle incomes and lower)",1,-3

"You say Bush will spend £6.5bn. on the disater. In fact he will not spend a single penny. The belief that he will is a common misconception. There is many a slip between money allocated and cash recieved.   Poverty and need does not mean a deficiency in accommodation, food, water, transport or security. It means a financial deficit in cash.  10,000 people died in the hurricane. all of them were poor. No social worker died in the hurricane. It will cost £7bn. to process the corpses and all that cash will go to the wealthy. £1000 cash would have saved all their lives but none all of it would have gone to the poor.  People are either concerned about poverty or gannets. Nobody can be concerned about poverty and gannets. Whatever food goes to a gannet does not get to the poor.   Nobody can have their cake and eat it. Either the poor can be fed or the gannets who hang around them distributing ""services"".  All governments should produce properly audited accounts detailing the disparity between cash designated and cash recieved.

"The big winner is Iran. The big loser is the Bush/Blair/Neo-Con/Israeli doctrine of using overwhelming military force to deal with ""terrorists"".  Iran has won both in Gaza, Lebanon and Iraq, precisely because there is democracy there. Iran supports organizations that have popular support. The governments there cannot say: We don't like the groups supported by Iran (perhaps under presure from the US), so we are going to close them down. That can only happen in Egypt, Jordan and in Saudi Arabia.  Iran has also validated their military doctrine. Hezbollah's military wing was trained by Iran and they performed pretty well against Israel. Also, the bunkers designed by Iran were able to withstand Israeli bombardments. This means that Iran's revolutionary guard would perform well in a war against the US.   If the US attacks Iran, then that will trigger a repeat of the Lebanon war, but now on a much larger scale. Iran will fire missiles at the oil installations in the Gulf. The US will try to stop that using air power, but that won't work. They would then have no choice but to invade Iran. Ultimately the US will be forced to sign a humiliating cease fire with Iran.",2,-3

But asked whether they had sympathy with the feelings and motives of the four British Muslim bombers, 13 per cent said they had a lot of sympathy and another 11 per cent had a little.

"Ethnic Cleansing, ""Apartheid""! What's the matter stuck for ""Atrocity""?""  No because for me words have meaning.  Avigdor Liberman for example is an outspoken supporter of ethnic cleansing and other ""treatments"" (involving busses)  And he is Israel's Deputy PM isn't he.  ""Perhaps you could start by explaining how Israel is an Apartheid state with between 1.3 and 1.6 million Israeli Arabs.""  Er what is your point.  SA had millions of blacks.  You can't have apartheid without someone to be apartheid against.  The point is that the extreme gang who form the israeli government (whose nominal head is facing rape charges, whose PM is up against corruption and whose deputy PM is known even in his own country as a supporter of ethnic cleansing)distinguish and give different rights to jewsih and non-jewish citizens.  The Palestinians have no rights at all, though they are compelled to pay Israeli taxes etc  No Israeli even disputes this.  ""Did you see the Arab/Palestinian supporters injured while rioting in Jerusalem? They were treated by Israeli medics and hospitals. How does that fit with Apartheid?""  Do you know how many non-jews are allowed to join the Israeli police force?  Do you know who the head of the force is and all the senior officers?  Do you know non-jewish citizens of Jerusalem are being slowly ethnically cleansed fromt he city.  Perhaps you should try learning something.",1,-4

"I don't know why the Catholic hierarchy crucifies itself with this decades-long sex obsession [ever since the advent of easily available contraception for all].  In developed countries contraception is used by almost all Catholics [else why would family size be so low].  My [Catholic] mother - in all other respects fully observant - used contraception from the early 1950s on to limit her family to 2 without feeling her adopted faith compromised.  The hierarchy here has had to turn a very blind eye to lay practice and the laity has had to make its own peace with God about this, sidestepping the clergy.  Focus on this issue has undermined the authority of the church and attempting to shore it up in Africa is going to fail too.  Talk about flogging a dead horse.    The use of condoms in the context of Aids is a health issue and could be justified even by the Catholic hierarchy on that basis - any contraceptive effect being an 'unfortunate' side-effect, just as - say - treatment for cancer might involve a person becoming sterile as a side effect.  No-one argues that they shouldn't be treated for cancer on account.  Aids is just as deadly.",2,-2

That he comply with the restrictions brought in after Gulf 1? That he must allow unfettered access to inspections? That he had WMD in the past, used it in the past and was intent on developing WMD?

"George Tenet has aired out the dirty drawers of the Bush Administration in his book ""At the Center of the Storm.""  The Ex-CIA Chief takes the blame for the erroneous National Intelligence Estimate in 2002 that was used to justify the Iraq invasion.   ""Remember, when you write an estimate, when you estimate, you're writing what you don't know,"" he said. “In retrospect, we got it wrong partly because the truth was so implausible.""   Tenet reveals the Bush administration had already concluded Iraq was going to face consequences before the estimate was finished in 2002.   He recalls running into Richard Perle at the White House on Sept. 12, 2001. Perle ""said to me, 'Iraq has to pay a price for what happened yesterday, they bear responsibility. I remember thinking to myself as I'm about to go brief the president, 'What the hell is he talking about?""'   He also writes ""There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat.”  Tenet claims Dick Cheney wanted to ""handpick"" Iraq's leaders after Saddam’s fall and limit the country’s involvement. This was despite proclaiming publicly that establishing a democratic government was among the reasons for the invasion.   Cheney and Pentagon officials pushed for a ruling coalition that included Ahmed Chalabi, Kurdish leaders and exiled Hussein opponents   ""Rather than risking an open-ended political process that Americans could influence but not control, they wanted to be able to limit the Iraqis' power and handpick those Iraqis who would participate. You had the impression that some Office of the Vice President and DOD reps were writing Chalabi's name over and over again in their notes, like schoolgirls with their first crush,"" Tenet writes.   <a href=""http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6599183.stm"">news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/...</a> <a href=""http://www.centredaily.com/128/story/83223.html"">www.centredaily.com/...</a> <a href=""http://www.denverpost.com/sportscolumnists/ci_5785691"">www.denverpost.com/s...</a>",1,-3

""And I have explained how this was originally colonialism but they assimilated with the locals so they too became arabs so and not arabs ruling over ""middle easterners"".

"Your definition of Palestine keeps changing. Sometimes it includes the whole area, sometimes it doesn't exist at all.++++  So there is no doubt. After 1922 Mandate Palestine was reduced to the area that currently consists of Israel, West Bank and Gaza. On creating the Mandate The Lebanon, Syria and Jortdan were ALSO part of the area called Palestine, but renamed to those country names.  Hence, the only area that can be called Palestine now is West Bank and Gaza. This area was equally granted as The Jewish National home and a place where Arabs can live and until it becomes an official State with a constitution, recognised government and the institutions of state such as legislature etc then it is still Palestine and still subject to the Mandate.  So, the question still remains. Where is the Lebanese Palestinians Home?",1,-1

"Hi Goldwater,  Goldwater quote: “not having a say in whether country goes to war, when your government starts to break the law itself... you know what I call this? I call THIS a dictatorship.”  You have your say at the ballot box. If you disagree with Blair choosing to help regime change a mass murdering dictator named Saddam then vote him out. The UK is a democracy and if you choose to be isolationist or ignore mass murdering dictators then vote that way.  Calling the UK a dictatorship just shows you have no idea what a dictatorship really is.  Goldwater quote: “If you deny people the right to protest you are not worth to be called a democrat .”  Those are your words not mine. Where did I say you don’t have the right to protest?   Go protest the regime change all you want after all the UK is a democracy but don’t try to deny the obvious that marching to stop the regime change of Saddam is supporting keeping Saddam in power.  Goldman quote: “Oh really? And who decides this,”  Circumstance put Milosvic, the Taliban and Saddam in the cross hairs. Personally I am happy to see the end of each of them. It could have been the military junta in Burma, Castro, Kim Jong and I would have been just as happy. I simply want open season on dictatorships in the 21st century and am not going march in the street or cry to try to save any of them.  Goldman quote: “yes, he was a bloody dictator”  But but but the infamous but! Then why did you march in the street to try to keep two of the world’s oldest democracies from regime changing Saddam?  Goldman quote: “I am sure it was terrible. But so is Saudi Arabia. So it Kuweit, so is Nigeria, and so is Egypt...those heavens of the fighters for human rights.”  And in the end they will all go down but circumstance put your anti American folk hero Saddam at the front of the line. If Kuwaeit, Nigeriam, Saudi etc had started two wars, filled dozens and dozens of mass graves then many they would have been ahead of Saddam but that is not how it worked out. Even so there is nothing you can do to save Saddam. He is gone.  Goldman quote: “where I told you that it is not up to cowboys such as you to decide WHO is going to do WHAT.”  Why shouldn’t democracies take proactive action to drive dictatorships into extinction. It’s the 21st century and they should not exist so they should be taken out one by one.  Do what you want to stop your government from taking out dictators like Saddam. After all the UK is a free country but don’t try to dodge the fact that marching to try to save a dictator from regime change is supporting that dictator.  There is simply no way to dodge that reality.  Warmest Regards, Smoker",2,-3

"Hi Bouncy Helen.  Irony is lost on you, it appears.  I really don't care what happens to corner shops, or their relationship with the big retailers.  It simply seems to me that this issue, more than most perhaps, is something that can be left to people to decide for themselves.  I note that you have avoided all my questions regarding the ""correct"" level of employment within the retail sector, or why it would be a good thing for the retail sector to become more labour intensive.  Your point does not follow that if Tesco is very profitable then it must be poor value.  Your position in general illustrates why regulators should stay out of market decisions: perception of value is the result of a myriad of factors given varying weight by a myriad of individuals.  I, for instance, am well aware that the Tesco's fruit &amp; veg aisle represents mediocre value and is none too pleasant to boot.  However, my time is valuable, and I don't always get the opportunity to go to my favourite fruit and veg store.  I feel guilty about this (nothing I can't handle) and do it anyway.  Others may like the fact that they are shopping at a big trusted name.  Others may like the fact that what they want is always in stock.  Or that there is a relatively hasslefree returns section.  Basically, so what if they are more efficient in labour terms?  Do you have any other sectors which you would like to see become more labour-intensive?  I presume also that you will be pressuring government to curb Internet shopping for the same reason.  Personally, I look forward to the day when Wal-Mart cuts a swathe through the whole lot of them.

It has been suggested, on numerous occasions, that our friends across the pond are taught from the ""How to Maintain National Pride Post-European Explore, Conquer and Exploit Period"" textbooks published by the official (and state funded) ""European Revisionist History Textbook Corporation.""    Amerindians in Mexico are still screaming to be heard.  They are usually found at the bottom of the Mexican social heirarchy.  Sixty percent of the population of Mexico is ""mestizo"" (mixed Amerindian and EUROPEAN SPANISH blood), 30% claim to be PREDOMINATELY Amerindian, 9% are white (where did they come from?) 1% other.  Mestizo, who have a great deal of EUROPEAN SPANISH pride, refer to the Mexican Amerindian derogatorily as ""indio.""  Mexicans who claim the white Euros ""stole"" their land in the southern part of the US, are also guilty of having ""white Euro"" ancestors who stole land from their own ancestors (comical really--I wonder how their internal ancestral mix are able to cohabitate?).  Historically, Spaniards born in Spain were the ruling class and highest on the social ladder... 2nd were Mexican-born Spaniards, 3rd were mestizo and last on the ladder were the ""indios"" and all others...  After Mexico won their independence from Spain (after 3 centuries of Spanish rule), the ""creole"" (Spaniards born in Mexico) became the ruling class and highest on the social ladder... which is where they remain today...   Furthermore, 95 - 98% of all Amerindians (indigenous peoples throughout the ""Americas"") were wiped out (European introduced diseases) during the European explore, conquer and exploit period--long before any European inhabitant of the ""new world"" started dreaming about independence from Europe.  By comparison, very few indigenous people lost their lives after the US gained independence from Britain.  We will take (and have taken) responsibility for our part.  It has been far to convenient for the Europeans to blame everything on the ""Americans"" when they were the architects of the destruction of the Amerindian.",1,-3

Equally, there are many second generation immigrants out there speaking English no different from their 'true-Brit' compatriots.  Now an Israeli accent.  That's another thing entirely.

"     For the hundredth time, they were NOT jailed 'for speaking their minds' they were jailed for  inciting others to kill people. And incidentally their own speech comprised of threatening with violence OTHER people who might wish to exercise free speech. That's an act of intimidation others into silence, not of universal free speech.  It's not 'free speech' for A to say to B that if B draws a cartoon B should be killed. It's simply an incitement to murder, designed to suppress the free speech of OTHERS.     That's the sort of veiled threat we have become very used to hearing in Britain. Large numbers of the British public have tired of it, because one set of dark mutterings is followed by another. The cartoon protests here took place in a country where the media and government had NOT published the actual cartoons, in case of more outraged Muslims. The response of the people in question was not to say “thank you for your consideration,” but to go out calling for our beheading, annihilation, extermination etc, anyway. That is to say, whether one appeases or confronts such people they will always make angry threats. That’s why it is better to meet them head on.   If these cases had not been brought - and the authorities only did so after massive public anger - then the next such protest would almost certainly have resulted in a huge riot and deaths. If it were to have reached that stage, then you and the other cheerleaders for the cartoon protesters here - would have had to grasp that ‘provoking’ an angry minority is as nothing, in terms of danger, compared to provoking an angry majority.

"This is what I ""submitted to Have Your Say"":  The North Koreans don't need the bomb for protection because they already have China as an ally.  Having the bomb serves as a deterrence against US military involvement should Kim Jong Il start to press his expansionist aims in the region.  This also explains why the North Korean government are so keen to promote news of the test.  A nuclear exchange remains unlikely but the probability of conventional conflict in the Korean peninsula has definitely increased.  Of course it didn't get published (I hate ""Fully Moderated"" - a.k.a. HYS censorship mechanism).  But with only 500 characters there's plenty of stuff that didn't get expounded on.  Kim Jong Il's frustration is that he can't use his massive army without incurring a US military response.  But the bomb implies massive US casualties up front - I doubt if the US Congress would have backed the invasion of Iraq if they'd've known it meant 3,000 dead.  It's only that the casualties have been incurred over a few years that has numbed their power to shock the US population.  Intelligence from post-1991 Iraq indicated that Saddam didn't think he was wrong to have invaded Kuwait, just that he should have waited to acquire the bomb first.  Of course China is unhappy with KJ-I but they would still probably stand by NK in the event of a military incursion by others.  I also doubt they would actually attack NK in the event that Pyongyang precipitate a conflict (i.e. invade SK).",1,-3

"I am an unabashed zionist and proud supporter of Israel. I have in the past had two significant events in my life where I interacted with muslims and arabs. In one I worked for a year with Feisal eighteen inches to my right and Muhammad eighteen inches to my left. Both were of Indian extraction, one being Pakistani and the other Indian. The other experience was where I worked for six months in a small company that was entirely staffed by lebanese, both christian and muslim. The two owners with whom I worked closely everyday were a lebanese christian and a muslim syrian.  With just about all of these people I participated in completely engaging but civil debate. Muhammad and I had a lot of fun as he was a huge cricket fan and taught me the ins and outs, but he was apolitical. Feisal was an observant muslim of a liberal sect. We traded a lot of details about life in a mosque in comparison to life in a synagogue. He was a bona fide genius I think, and he also opened my eyes to issues vis-à-vis the muslim world and the U.S.A. The syrian was a brilliant man extremely well versed in contemporary history. He had me really working hard and I had to re-examine a lot of previously conceived notions I had.  By the way, all without exception were western educated; not necessarily in western institutions but rather in the western tradition.  I like to think I am an intellectually honest person. I invite you to travel the link to my posts to examine my arguments.  This has been my experience:   I have met here some rabid pro-zionists whose posts I personally find embarrassing. The rabid anti-zionists seem to be an order more vitriolic. I can sense the blind hatred. Also, they are easily frustrated with the simplest critical thinking. There really is no debate here at all. It is all quips based on self-enforcing and cross-referenced hate propaganda. To even question its veracity brings immediate indirect fire as opposed to an actual response.  Based on my own reading and research there is certainly a palestinian narrative of merit. To say otherwise, in my opinion, is nonsensical. I have participated in excellent debate and exchange of information here on these boards. A fair number of times I have been challenged by posters' comments that required me to stop and re-examine my thinking. Always these have been alleged facts that I was not previously aware of and I spent the time researching the issue and verifying the facts. A Case on point is my discussion with Ed regarding water usage in Israel/P-Territories.  Without exception every post that I felt had merit and that I fact-checked did not pan out. Some citations were to reputable pro-Palestinian sources that  I had to delve a lot deeper into the primary source data (UN reports and the like). A lot was just unsubstantiated myth mongering devoid of any sources at all. Some others were simply foolish. I remember one citation that was to a headline to the effect of ""Israel - [some atrocity]"". I tried clicking the headline but there was no link, no links anywhere on the page for that matter. It was just a list of made up headlines. I very strongly notice that all of the pro-palestinian myth mongering is cross-referenced. Each ""argument"" refers to other self-documenting resources that refer back in a web of cross-references.  Then, of course, there is Pallywood and fauxtography, the arab/muslim art of invented videos and photographs.  Finally, there are out-and-out lies that are apparent on their face, ranting really.  I did my own research into the apparently endless list of Israeli atrocities. I found several clear acts of improper military behaviour, but only a few.  I found some of unacceptable civilian behaviour towards palestinians. Then there is the government based acts, an example of which is uprooting olive orchards. Finally, there are actual war crime type atrocities, for example, the 800-900 arab deaths in this category during the 1948 war as explained by the ""new"" historian Benny Morris.  Now, do I mean that palestinians are not killed--not at all. In my view, the vast majority of so-called atrocities, war crimes, genocide, ethnic cleansing, animal behaviour, etc. ad nauseam, is related to the palestinian insurrection (Intifadah) in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank and the Israeli attempts to manage and quell the insurrection.  These actions fall into a few categories:  1. Clearing a designated military reserve of protestors 2. Quelling insurrection (rock throwing, etc.) 3. Immediate retaliation to armed attacks 4. Pro-active attacks by the IDF to degrade and destroy palestinian military capabilities 5. Ongoing border screening  In other words, I don't deny the suffering of individual palestinians. I both sympathize and empathize with the pain and suffering. The two peoples are at war. The IDF will make every effort to avert collateral damage, but civilians will get hit when a Qassam stockpile is hit. Palestinians have to wait hours at the border, but every parcel, truck, ambulance, and person must be physically checked for suicide vests and ordinance smuggling. Only about 5% of palestinian attackers get through. That means for every bombing in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem, 19 others were thwarted or caught at the border. For better or worse, until a final settlement is reached, Israel is responsible for the populations in the territories and for order and security. Violent insurrection cannot be allowed lest anarchy take hold. As part of the occupation, certain areas are classified by military authorities. The justness of it or not is not my point. When a soldier with a rifle under orders to clear the area tells you to do so, one takes his life into his own hands to disobey. When Qassam rockets are fired into Israel, you can bet your grand-mother's pearls that a bigger rocket is coming back your way. For that matter, if a palestinian fires rockets next to a civilian home, he knows that the return fire may hit that home as well. He ought to take responsibility for his choice. What are eight year olds doing throwing stones at tanks intermixed with adults armed with assault rifles.  All of this is ongoing military operations between two peoples at war. They are not acts of genocide or ethnic cleansing or anything like that.  With some exceptions, I find most pro-palestinian posters fall into one single pattern: a two or three sentence post of unsubstantiated outrageous claims. When one calls them out for evidence, I have gotten the run-around as I described above, or just non-answers. I have been engaged in serious debate by pro-palestinian supporters on these boards in only a small minority of instances.  I find that this profound penchant for dishonest debate is not so much acts of actual dishonesty, rather it is part and parcel of the overriding arab social characteristic of face-saving, i.e. self-deception. That is, as far as I can tell, so long is face is saved publicly, all is well. Prime examples of this are astounding claims of military victory in the face of catastrophic losses and on the verge of military annihilation.  By and large I find the scales of dishonest debate tips acutely toward the pro-Palestinian side.",2,-4

"''Ruth, what do you mean he hasn't addressed any of it.''  Whoops. Typo. that was intended as a question.  ''I know because he's completely missed what I've said and presented a completely false interpretation.''  (I assume we're talking about message 203.)  Rubbish. All he's trying to do is spell out his own opinions, and I fail to see how it's false, or irrelevant in a discussion the only aim of which seems to be to go round in circles talking about anti-semitism. I fail to see any particular direction in this discussion, least of all how it could ever have an end. That's a pattern I've noticed with much of your debates. The only reason I can tell for debating in such a way is that, as many people will attest, it gives you 'victories'. Well, not by my definition. There's more to debating than outlasting another poster.   ''Well that's a pretty good guess. I won't address what he's said specifically because it's totally missing the point of what I've been talking about.''  There you go. You're not constructively replying to what your opponent has to offer. You're simply refusing to debate it on the grounds that you disagree. In place of actually debating, you spend the whole time demanding that you're opponent retracts what he's said. To bolster this demand, you force words into your opponent's mouth and claim he (or she- no male inadequacy here) is 'demonizing' you, and other such clap trap.    ''That's an unsubstantiated statement on the back of a misrepresentation of what's being argued.''  That's his opinion, which he has inferred from what you have written. I have sympathy with his opinion.  ''All of THIS (of yours) is avoiding MY points still on the table''  Sorry Ruth, I don't have a clue what your points are.

It has costed us dear in pure economic terms, when the arbs turned the taps in 1973, following the unanimous western backing of Israel in the october war of that year.  The resulting recession was the worst the world had seen since the 30'ties , bringing the otherwise succesfull boom that have lasted more or less un-interrupted since the end of the second world war to an abrupt end. It made the prices go up 4 times, then salaries rose 4 times, with the inevitable result of a 4 times rise in inflation, when governments tried to cushion the crisis by taking on loans.

By the way, this just reminds me of a sad personal story:  Years ago my mother was on an Ulpan program rooming with a young Palestinian woman and they became close friends.  At that time my mother was a big swimmer and availed herself of the swimming pool on a daily basis for exercise and heat relief.  After a number of months, her friend asked if she could go with my Mom early one morning and have my Mom teach her how to swim.  They did this once and it resulted in verbal hostility from some Arab men who happened to witness it.  She wore a VERY conservative (by Western standards, of course) one piece swimsuit and was careful to remain fully covered up until the last possible moment when entering and exiting the pool.  A day later, the woman came to my Mom in tears because the word had gotten back to her family in the West Bank and they had phoned her threatening to remove her from the program if she did that again.  She went again -- this time even earlier to avoid being seen and even more careful with regard to modesty.  Her family made good on their threat and she was gone in a matter of days and my Mom was never able to contact her and to this day doesn't know whether she received any of her letters or not or what became of her.  I don't care what people wanna do with regard to modesty and dress, in theory:  But I do object to legal adults being denied the right to make their own decision on what they want to wear in places where it's acceptable for others to dress the same -- ie, if it's at a pool where swimsuits are accepted attire at that time.",2,-4

The point here is there have ALWAYS been Muslim's in that region for the past 1000 years that have outnumbered the Jews. Therefore, the current Palestinian's have had far more ancestors living over the past millenia then the number of Israeli ancestors, since most of them are all immigrants and therefore have no traceable family history in the region before the 20th century.

"There is little room for becoming "" homosexual after birth. People are indeed born that way, but it is not known what the reason is why they are what they are. OK?""  Hi Conny, Zabak, others  Lets not pretend that Rahman's paper settles the issue.  I think the current understanding is that sexual orientation does not fall neatly into discrete categories, but rather places a person on a continuum ranging from enitrely attracted to the same sex or entirely attracted to the opposite sex. Whatever genetic influence there is on sexual orientation then, it is not 'either or'.  Beyond that cultural factors do seem to push peoples orientation this way or that. Its worth noting that absolute sexual categories did not/do not exist in some cultures. (Ancient Greece)  It is a little smililar to whether people are left/right handed oddly enough. It is estimated that hereditary factors account for just 32 percent of variability in handedness, but that doesnt account for 90% of people being right handed. A cultural bias towards right handedness accounts for that more effectively.  People can and do change their sexual orientation in the course of their lives. 'Gay' people go 'straight', 'straight' people go 'gay'.  the importance of cultural factors in determining sexual orientation should be acknowleged. Self actualisation is an important factor in personal happiness (and therefore, social cohesion). People must not be brought up to think that they are (or must be) exactly one way or another.  Here is a decent paper on it:  <a href=""http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15176896"">cat.inist.fr/?aModel...</a>  Note that my concern is that people should be able to freely discover their position on a continuum rather than to ""cure"" a natural/social orientation. The field of study is frought with political issues obviously, that should not clould investigation. As scientists we want to just know what is going on, not determine what should go on.",3,-2

"   I think you're being hypocritical, John.  You attempt to dismiss any and all disagreement with your representation by pre-empting a few potential counterpoints and denoting them ""go[ing] round in escalating circles"", thereby showing no willingness whatsoever to hear differing viewpoints as you prematurely belittle them with your ""again if you wish"".  But that's PRECISELY what you're doing...  going round in circles!  Or at least that's how it appears to me in the absense of any apparent desire to go anywhere else...  Israel have said that they were within their rights under the ceasefire to engage in this action (and, according to the first link [IHT] that comes up from your google link, made this clear before the action):  Okay, this is something you think was a mistake and perhaps you and certainly others might disagree and believe it's more than just a bad PR decision but an actual violation...  But the main point you're missing is that the ceasefire violation by Hezbollah that Israel is claiming it was responding to has NOT been used by Israel as an excuse to abandon the ceasefire further than this action (or, presumably and reportedly, any others like it), from your beeb link:  ~ ~ ""Israel...insisted the truce held."" ~ ~  So where are you going?  Let's even say we agree that it was a PR mistake...  What happens next?  IS it an excuse for Hezbollah to announce a complete disconnection from the ceasefire?  IS it an excuse for the Lebanese government to renege?  Surely that gets it all back to where you suggest you don't want it -- going round in circles -- right?  Or is there something you haven't yet offered that would explain this apparent contradiction?  The BBC article you link to inadvertently touches on this further in parallel to this point and I think it's key to the conflict and, unfortunately, in much of the discussion going on it's being avoided:  ~ ~ ""The BBC's Nick Childs in Beirut correspondent says the UN's main concern is that the incident both highlights the urgent need for UN reinforcements and will put off potential troop contributors, because it projects an image of insecurity."" ~ ~  An ""image of insecurity""?  It didn't have that before?  So ""the UN's main concern"" is that any troops it might send will be aware of what's going on?  Is that a sneaked snippet of the planned 'rules of engagement'... know as little as possible about the conflict and make sure any and all troops are given a false sense of security just to ensure that they will, once again, be nothing more than sitting ducks in the line of fire?  And these parallels emanate from the same underlying point illustrated above and again as we see from the Lebanese Defense Minister (also from the beeb article):  ~ ~ ""He said any rocket fired from Lebanese territory would be considered collaboration with Israel to provide a pretext for it to strike. ... ...[he] said that if the UN failed to give ""clear answers"" in response to the raid he ""might be forced to ask the cabinet early next week to halt the army deployment in the south""."" ~ ~  So there we are:  That's the only result I can see of a discussion criticizing Israel for this 'PR disaster'...  Excuse for Hezbollah, excuse for Siniora and excuse for the UN.  Of course it warrants addressing but it's your purpose that will define how it's addressed and your address which will expose your purpose and, at the moment, it appears to be a desire to go round in circles and add your weight to the 'PR disaster'.",1,-3

They no longer have debtor's prisons and the lenders must suffer the loss.  If as you say that is the case in America and/or Canada it is not so simple in England.  If a property doesn't realise the sum secured against it then the borrower is still liable to pay the difference and the absence of debtor's prisons does not negate that nor is it any guarantee that those who don't fulfill their obligations won't see the inside of a prison.  Current leniency toward personal bankruptcy may see some changes but that was not the case in the eighties and to my knowledge it was a busy time for bailiffs in many areas.   ""There is a correction going on in the housing market and it will be international. It began over a year ago and people should have been paying attention.""  Again, I can't speak for the US or Canada but such a correction has been widely predicted here for a few years and whilst it may be international it is also likely to be regional in effect.    ""But if you are happy in your home and don't have a large mortgage, or aren't holding one, then it really won't matter.""  There's nothing in current predictions that are any concern to me.",1,-3

What we have learned in dozens and dozens of invasions and occupations the normal thing is to resist the invaders rather than spend the time killing your neighbors and ordinary civilians blowing up other ordinary civilians is not normal behavior.  For example many countries in Asia were occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army from China to Korea to the Philippines to Thailand etc and the civilians under occupation never started blowing each other up in markets or temples etc.  When the US army occupied Japan and other asian countries the Japanese &amp; other civilians never started to kill each other.  Nazi Germany occupied most of Europe and the Europeans never started to kill each other.  Then the Russians occupied Eastern Europe and the allies Western Europe after the war and the civilians didn’t start to kill each other after three days, three years etc.  India was occupied by the British for years and years and the Indians didn’t suddenly turn on their neighbors and start killing them.  Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Macedonia etc were occupied by the Ottomans and the civilians didn’t turn on each other.  The Muslims occupied Spain for seven centuries and the Spanish didn’t start killing each other after a 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months or 3 years etc.  Tibet has been occulted by the Chinese since the 1950s and the Tibetan civilians didn’t start to kill each other.  However today we have attack after attack from ordinary Muslims on other ordinary Muslims in the Market, Schools, Hospitals, and Mosques day after day in Iraq so explain how this muslim on muslim violence is a Western conspiracy?

"Hi Speed!  Sorry for not coming back to your comments earlier, my day got busy…  “I have mixed feelings about it Vina.” Yes. So do I, which is why I posted the question. There are so many possibilities and different scenarios, that I think we can only point at the most general and usual cases. So I think that that is why the Harrison Ford case is  not applicable to most people. Certainly this is millionaire celebrity and given his financial status, as you said, he will not be confronted with the typical cases of not being able to pay babysitting for the not so pleasant tasks J, more time available for parenting, etc.   ”Perhaps in some ways even a better parent as they would have years more wisdom and life experience to pass along, be more mature themselves than say a very young parent might be.”  Yes that may be a positive thing, but also the bigger the generational gap the most difficult it may be to understand each other.   ”So, I think that a given persons financial stability, emmotional readiness, maturity level and frame of time to actually spend with the child - particularly during the early developemental years, plays more of a significant role in what sort of parent they will make than does their age.  ”Lets face it, its just like that Harry Chapin song ""Cats in the Cradle""” I love that song….  “ by the time most kids are in their late teens and beyond, they dont spend all that much time with their parents anyway.:” True. This is however more than not the rule of life, but by the time children pass the teenage stage, get into adulthood and most of all, as they become parents themselves, then they will start “respecting” their parents again and begin to understand in retrospect why their parents acted the way they did…so parents now become the best friends, allies and advisers.  This is the part that I see as downside when having children late in life…  Now in the case of this woman in the article, she had twins. Speed, I can tell you how I was super-handful with one! So even as a young person, I was exhausted all the time! And the second baby came less than 2 years after (I know the same was for you)…so how this woman, who naturally wont have all the energy of a person in her 20s or 30s, will be able to cope with newborn twins!!!?

"I would have to say I'm torn on the issue. On one hand, I like the idea of having work to do here in the US. I like money, I like having a job. And when people buy from my company (an American one), I get to keep my job. I know there's all sorts of talk from people about how 'oh protectionism doesn't work!' Reality is: if my company doesn't make money, they lay off tons of people. Which they have done and continue to do.<br><br>There should be incentive to keeping jobs in the US, and it shouldn't come at just a monetary price tag. Unfortunately, it's all about the money. And if there's no money to be made here, then there's no reason to have companies here.<br><br>We have nothing to export. We don't have tons of cheap labor. We can't survive on $2/day like they can in some of these nations. We've built regulations into our system to protect our workers and our consumers. We can't just go throwing lead paint into toys and poisons into toothpaste to reduce the cost of production.<br><br>Unfortunately, as a result of this and the result of the ability to communicate and travel to far off nations there's no incentive at all to have jobs here when you can make significantly more money doing it elsewhere.<br><br>So yes, I believe we need some way to enforce some minor protectionism in our economy. I'm not saying cut off completely import and export or anything of that nature. But I'm saying there needs to be incentive to stay focused on our country. There's nothing wrong with this.

Example: Ryan Franklin 2003. He had a career year where he was able to throw 200+ innings of quality pitching despite *zero* enhancement to his 'stuff,' was busted in 2004, and has since found starting significantly more difficult and has been relegated to a relief role.<br><br>2) Velocity induces *vastly* more swinging strikes than it does turning ordinary flyballs into home runs.

"Are you thinking about those 10-10-220, telephone commercials? He talks about that here: <br><br> 'I made an album in Las Vegas in the '60s, and a hippie friend said to me, 'Man, you sold out.' So I said, 'wait a minute, what is that over there?' And he said, 'It's a phone, man.' I said, 'That's Ma Bell. You're cooperating with them. You have one of their implements in your home. You sold out.' By that I mean that this thing is on a scale. The alternative, the real pure path, is to live in the woods, make your own clothing, and perhaps eat small game, if you can catch it. You have to choose how much you're willing to put up with for your purposes. So, I am a reluctant participant in the commercial world because that's what they have here, that's the way they keep score, and I'm not about to go live in the woods. If this were a culture where everything was free, I would do this for free. I would go from campfire to campfire, dragging my stone tablet of jokes around for people to see in exchange for pieces of meat. It would be a nicer system. But that's not the way it is.<br> That being said ... In the early '80s I discovered that I had made bad business decisions during the last half of the '70s and was deeply in debt to the IRS. It was still 70 percent tax time. I was behind. The penalties and interest were burying me, and I had no career to speak of. So a friend of mine, a promoter, became my manager, and we began to dig out of this, and it's taken me 20 years. When the people from 10-10-220 came to me, I said, 'Well, it's a phone service, it's not a poison gas, it's not gasoline, let me listen to these people.' They gave me full creative control over the imagery and the content, and they wanted to use me doing my stand-up. So I made what I consider a compromise, or an adjustment. That's my personal euphemism for it -- we all make adjustments to our value system according to our needs and what we can tolerate.'",2,-2

"National Socially Responsible Health Care!!!<br>Whatwe need is nationalized health care that keeps all of the money sucking fat companies totally out of it. All the health care costs should be borne by the country itself since too much time and money is spent figuring out who is responsible for all the carcinogens, pesticides, and everything else in the country that has unknown side effects. And then adding profit margins, advertising, legal costs, CEO benefits onto the cost. Not only that the profit motive makes the first priority of any company the avoidance of coverage as much as possible. That is an insane approach to the health and welfare of a nation and it's national security. As we know we are all affected by the lack of treatment of diseases of everyone else!

The fact of the matter is I like watched the caped crusader fight the joker....

At a time when video tape had barely made it into homes, Philips and Pioneer had the guts to develop and commercialize a laser-based optical disc system. IN THE '70s. Let's see: uncompressed video, stereo (and, later, Dolby AC-3) sound, directors' cuts, extras (some even had the entire script of the film on the disc). And no wear. And selling for $35 per movie, when crappy, mono, quickly worn-out VHS tapes were selling for $100.<br><br>LaserDisc could have topped DVD's picture quality if it had offered anamorphic and progressive images, because it was uncompressed.

".NET should be ditched and Mono should rise, meaning C# people should code toward mono and not .NET. In term what this will do is force Microsoft out of ownership of the C# coding language.

Though with an open implementation combo of C#/GTK#/Qt#(its called something else) i noticed this is actually a good thing, except for the fact Mono is trying ot be a 100% clone of .NET and not try to surpass it that is an issue.<br><br>Basically what i want to see happen with Mono is that it integrates functions and parts from all over into it, basically anyone who builds extentions to Mono-C# don't hesitate to begin integrating these things in the mainline design.<br><br>So pretty much if Mono continues to be brain dead step child of .NET then i can't truly support C#, but if people force Mono as the C# standard then its well worth it.",2,-2

The basis for comparison doesn't hold up. A regular user can go trough 3 lines of coke in about as much time as a drunk takes a swig of beer. So it might be $4-$8 a line but you'll end up doing 15-20 a night (a cokehead's night can end at 3 pm the next day) So if you say that the average drunk will drink 10 beers in a night at about $5 a beer.

A lot of our military weaponry and defense systems rely on satellites for GPS and remote controls, and our ABM systems depend on an intact communication system.

"@TinmanHero - The Bible is the word of God written by MAN. It is a true collection of stories written as lessons. You don't have to take the actual words literally to be a believer. I am a Christian but I don't think that the heavens, Earth and everything was created in 7, literal, days. Seven days could be tens or hundreds of thousands, or millions, of years. 'Soon' is given as the time when Jesus will return and we all know that soon to us obviously isn't 'soon' to God as it's been a couple thousand years so far. As an engineer I am well aware of the mountains of evidence of evolution and fully believe it to be true as well. The two are not mutually exclusive.<br><br>You will say that it awfully convenient that we can't prove God exists. But I tell you this...It's awfully convenient that something is either fully, literally, true or it isn't true at all. I think you need to think more fully, and critically, about the possibilities that exist rather than claiming something isn't true because there is no proof, without any proof of your own.",2,-2

"It was the individual who believed the cat 'felt there was something wrong.' And you're debating on the cats 'knowledge' ?! Now, if you're really paying attention you'll put together a few things; notice that it is mentioned the cancer was in an early stage, and could have gone undetected for five or more months. The cats behavior must have seemed random or spontaneous to the individual (hence his concern being triggered by an event which wasn't normal). You can very reasonably assume that cat may have sensed a *difference* in the owners 'state' from one point in time to another. The cat doesn't need to think there's something 'wrong,' I'm sure if the cats senses were capable of detecting oder from the cancer then it was simply recognizing and curious about a change, nothing more.<br><br>The question of 'good' or 'bad' is irrelevant, it's people who determine that subjectively, well all animals eventually learn it hence being able to avoid danger. It could be just a coincidence, albeit an incredible one, the cats behavior was apparantly as 'recently odd' as the cancer within this individuals lungs.<br><br>It's possible this is a coincidence, and evidence from research suggests it may not be. I'm not going to make a decision either way, I'll just appreciate the new information I've been able to consume and learn more about it in time.<br><br>The important question is; 'could the cat have detected the cancer?' - Where on the body the cat was scratching is the only place I see the greatest possibility for coincidence.

For those who simply bit off more than they could chew (e.g. making $50K a year, yet got a $500K loan), let them sink or swim on their own.",1,-2

"@Rafikichi The dollar is not in the equation. I realize that dollars/pounds/yen are just pieces of paper whose values can be bubbles or (like the American dollar probably soon will) rapidly devalue.<br><br>Gold/silver are like currency in many ways though. They do have the advantage that, since it is difficult to print gold the market isn't likely to get flooded with gold - but many minerals and stones share this characteristic.What makes gold so special? It's all in our heads - just like every other bubble. <br><br>Land is even more difficult to print than gold. It grows more scarce with increases in population. Houses often come with land and represent a significant amount of labor. If one owns a home with a value of 'x' they will enjoy far more benifits than a person who owns a sum of gold with an equal value. The housing bubble was dumb but not as dumb as the gold bubble. <br><br>I'm not saying buying gold is necessarily stupid - you can get very rich off of bubbles as many did with housing - just be aware that they pop.<br><br>Also wealth is destroyed. Depreciation, vandalism, consumption (eg. food), and reduction in number of services provided all destroy wealth. I believe what you are getting at is that wealth doesn't instantly evaporate unless ICBMs are launched. It is important to be aware that these factors do erase wealth because as a recession or depression wears on they will force some gold owners to cash in their investment to replace other assets. This will cause gold to start consistently losing value. This will cause a loss of confidence in the bubble - then it will pop.",1,-2

It depends on a million things, but the basics are if there's a criminal conviction in drugs, then it opens up the money game. This may only be with felonies, which may go toward Ms. Krause's words about the sheriff expecting 500 plants instead of her 24.<br><br>Anyway, assuming many things:<br>* Bust somebody and later there's a conviction<br>* The county then sues the (new) felon in civil court using the criminal conviction as evidence<br>* Based on that evidence, the county gets the land, the car found there, etc.<br><br>It's very big money. While drug cases have special provisions to make it easier for the government to get the goods, it can also apply to other crimes. Such as if somebody robs a bank, the county can sue to get the car that was used in the crime. Otherwise, the car would (should) be returned after the case is over, even if the person is convicted.<br><br>For drug cases, many times law enforcement is able to find a boatload of cash. Not for Ms Krause's 24 plants, but if they find a briefcase full of money, the county sues, gets the cash, and then they buy more ambulances, firetrucks, police cars, oak desks for the city counsel, etc.<br>",1,-2

Good bacteria can run a muck and cause disease too. We call them good bacteria because they are naturally part of the fauna of our bodies and in normal numbers they contributes to our health. When their numbers are too great they cause disease. Whole milk spoils as well.<br><br>Outside of the environment they are acclimatized to (adapted to) the bovine body those bacteria will likely not do as well giving room for other bacteria to grow. Many bacteria will be introduced at all levels of industrial handling and if those bacteria grow faster than the natural bovine fauna then you get dangerous whole milk. Part of the reason why pasteurization was mandated int he first place was the rampant cases of food poisoning due to bacteria introduced into the milk and which did better than the ones already in the milk.<br><br>Think of yeast infections.

Maybe we should stop looking down on a natural herb that goes from Mother Nature and start looking up to how legalization can help the hungry, sick and homeless - not to mention our overall economic situation.

"'Congress needs to craft innovative legislation that makes health care more affordable without raising taxes or increasing the deficit. It also needs to repeal bad laws that keep health care costs higher than necessary. ' 'We should remember that HMOs did not arise because of free-market demand, but rather because of government mandates. The HMO Act of 1973 requires all but the smallest employers to offer their employees HMO coverage, and the tax code allows businesses – but not individuals – to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums. The result is the illogical coupling of employment and health insurance, which often leaves the unemployed without needed catastrophic coverage.' 'While many in Congress are happy to criticize HMOs today, the public never hears how the present system was imposed upon the American people by federal law. As usual, government intervention in the private market failed to deliver the promised benefits and caused unintended consequences, but Congress never blames itself for the problems created by bad laws. Instead, we are told more government – in the form of “universal coverage” – is the answer. But government already is involved in roughly two-thirds of all health care spending, through Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs.

"I ran Reading Half yesterday and was really pleased with my time and thought generally it was well organised, however what did disappoint me (aside from teh 45 min delay) was the number of slower runners that started at the front despite there being markers to indicate times. I have to admit that I was in the box ahead of where I should have been but one comment I heard was 'Ooh it says sub - 1:20, perhaps we should move back'. The reply was 'no it will take us ages to cross the line'. I finished in 1.29 officially but it still took me 1 1/2 minutes to cross the line so my actual time was 1:27, and for the entire race I continually overtook people. I was glad I didnt start further back with the sub 1.30 where I should have been. But if it had been managed properly, then you wouldnt get people trying to start in a higher ability group and slow down those behind them who are in the correct group.",3,-3

The URWFRC point at Mudchute was great, even though I nearly missed it. (How could Flora put a water station there, of all places.).

Mrs T - First serious attempt at the distance/time as GR said can't be a 100% confident unsure of my MP endurance the furthest I have gone is 14 miles @ MP. My race tactics will be to get 20 miles in 2:10- 2:15 and then hang on for dear life. Is this a good plan?????,2,-3

"Hi Fiona,. Just catching up with the thread - sorry to hear the news. I'm dedicating my run to my father-in-law and a close friend both of whom died from cancer. My father-in-law also had a series of strokes - 2 major ones - so that's where I'll be getting my inspiration from at around 18 miles. I'll most likely be walking like him at that stage as well. Sorry that may sound sick but we had some lively banter going on between the two of us when he was alive. He was paralysed down the left hand side but he always made a joke about it and I used to take the mick out of him in return. Got us both laughing and he'll be watching me on the day and giving it back with interest!",3,-3

"Morning,. T map, jej,mrs t, dan a,ndo w, cy, blisters, oo, rb-congratulations and commiserations. Great reports. Ndo, I hope you are all right. 3 hours 6:51: for me. 1h29 at half way and just on time by 20 miles, but i had very tight hamstrings which were cramping up so I slowed to a pace that allowed me to get to the finish without stopping. I have mixed feelings this morning. The marathon is such an unnatural distance to run. Anyway it's great to be able to listen to your thoughts about the race and the banter and support on this thread has been fantastic this year. (People at work who haven't got a clue are already annoying me with their advice and anecdotes.). All the best and recover well. No running for me till Saturday and I have mayo on my sarnies at lunch today. I agree with dan a -.tapering is over-rated.",3,-3

"Bet I hold the record, I took SIX on Sunday morning before the start!!!!!!!! I know it was a really stupid thing to do but had the runs from Wednesday night until Saturday morning & lived on a diet of jam sandwiches & 6 pints of watered down lucozade sport per day, though little stayed inside. . This was my third FLM & I figured that even if I had to walk most of it, as long as I could stay bunged up I could complete and justifiably collect my sponsorship money. . As it turned out they worked a treat, I managed 4:27 which was about half an hour slower than I targeted before my illness. I was also back to normal service by Tuesday morning. . However I would NEVER advise anybody to run a marathon whilst ill, it was the most physically painful thing I have ever done.",2,-3

"doing only 12 400s, and with 2 mins recovery seemed like a real doddle compared with the 20 with far less recovery, even though the pace was faster - actually managed 7secs/lap faster than my last 2 20 x 400 supposedly at 10k pace sessions, so I'm pretty satisfied with that",2,-1
"Mokina - glad you are settling down in Dublin. Haven't got the foggiest how much 17.50 euros is but it sounds cheap, so yaaaaaaay! lol! And its not that you are getting older you know.

Tracey - Bradley is a star although we do argue like cat and dog at times. My older son laughs at us when he is around - he thinks we are so alike which is why we argue. Probably right - if I think I am right I don't let go and neither does Bradley. . I have a very tight calf muscle this morning. Its quite painful. And I am still knackered! I need an early night really but I have arranged to go out to dinner this evening at one of my old assistant manager's.

Pinks i do 400m sprints at 9.5/10.0 on the tredmill and 200m recovery at 7.0 on the running machine, my next trick is to set the incline at 1.0. after downloading that tredmill programme the bloke was saying that by settin it at that your forcing the hamstrings to do what they natrally do out on the road but if its flat then the muscles don't work as they should and tremill does it all for you... some thing like that any way, i'm sure you can word it better Rio!!!",3,-3

Back to back sub-3's are very possible. RB did it at Paris & London this year, and someone else finally managed it at Cardiff & NY. Plus, sub-3 will probably get you into the top 10. I'm currently crippled with a mystery knee injury, so taking a fortnight completely off, for the first time in about 8 years to recover. Might go up to watch Luton, if I can be arsed to get up early; I know a few guys who are running, plus it will be good to see a winning performance from the Jock.",2,-3

"I had an adventure on Sunday as I planned to run about 13 and ended up running 17 due to getting lost on Kingley Vale. It was completely my fault but the mist and heavy rain plus mud did not help. I did a speed session Monday, rested Tuesday with just a couple of sets of Tennis. I can still feel the effects of Sunday now, with a slight ankle twist and sore left knee but this is still minor on the pain scale. I do Plyometrics, (hopping helps to strengthen the ankle and I have exercises for my knee which ease the pain) This has worked well over several months. My plan of sticking to 2 hours went out the Window on Sunday as I was out for 2 hours 40 minutes. Still, good time on your feet. I will go back to 2 hours on Sunday and run a 9 miler on Thursday. I am still learning what best suits me as stacks of 2 month injuries have meant constant disappointment. However, the last 8 months has been good. I do 20 minutes static stretches after running and now do Plometrics 3 times a week to try and keep the injuries minimal and hopefully away. I am trying Isotonic drinks, Tauts, Cranberry and Blackberry after long runs to try and rehydrate and recover more quickly. I started on Sunday and this seems to help me recover quicker. Also, Glucosamine and Chondroitin, helps keep the joints supple and flexible. At least thats what I hope. I also have changed from icing injuries which never seemed to work for me, causing soft tissue damage if kept on too long, too Nurofen Gel which seems to help minor injuries recover more quickle. I am still looking forward to the Marathon and hoping for a good time. I will aim for 3.30 but will most probably end up with 3.40 to 3.45. The last 10K is the killer.",2,-3

First half marathon so is a PB but not a lot to beat! Have done longer runs but they are just trainign runs really. Getting into the races now!!,2,-1
"Desert Man : and I was going to complain about the icy wind this morning!!! - half-mile reps at everything between 6m/m (very encouraging) and 7m/m (very depressing). Could still feel last week's heavy mileage in the legs, but not a bad session all in. In terms of SW16 's point, yes, the marathon is a bit of a gamble, but after 3 of the little b*gg*rs, I'm starting to get a better idea about my strengths and weaknesses, and I can compare race times with last year. For instance, I ran 3.19 off a 1.34 half (no taper). If I can get back down to 1.32, or even a bit lower, 3.14 should be on the cards. . Interestingly, although I'd always thought that I was more of an endurance person than a speed person, my 10K time is actually my fastest as an age-graded percentage - but that may be because some girl called Paula keeps on running marathons relatively fast compared to half-marathons!!!",3,-3
"After missing much of last week due to shooting pains in calf, I managed 11 on Saturday with 2 reps of 1.75 miles (supposed to be 4 but I was being sensible)and 2hrs 40mins yesterday. Last hour was a struggle with my calf, the same as last Sunday. Hoping that if I can survive the next 2 weeks the tapering will allow the calf time to recover enough for me to get around FLM. All the these niggles have rather dampened my focus on sub 3.15 and instead I am looking at finishing being a real goal. Yeterdays run slightly ruined by one of the guys telling us towards the end that his watch made our run less than we thought. There again his story earlier in the run about his wife and a pig more than made up for it!!",2,-3

"Morning all, WELL DONE everyone! Bit of a strange one for me, my quads seemed to give up on me after 6 miles! Couldn't believe it! . I set off slower, think i got everything right in the build up, kept my fluid levels topped up, but obviously something not right. I think if i'd have cramped up after 18 for going off too fast i would've been disappointed with myself, cos it happened so early in the race after a mile or so of muttering expletives under my breath i managed to see the funny side of it. Although the prospect of running another 20M with what felt like two dead legs wasn't an appealing one! Anyway i shimmied along at whatever pace the legs would let me and finished in 3:31:29 in the end which surprised me as i thought i was heading for 4hrs+. After realising it wasn't my day i made the most of it and took everything in, stopped to see some friends, and was completely blown away by the support, tower bridge and along the dual carriageway were awesome! It's impossible not to smile heading down the last 800m! Can't really get my head round what went wrong and i'm not gonna beat myself up about it as it was the experience of a lifetime but i feel like i've got a little unfinished business with London now!

That will come all too soon! Euph, thanks for the York 5K entry form, I'll send it off today, I entered it last year but didn't run due to foot injury. Also sending entry off for Wheldrake 10K and hope to get a place with you and Beders on that. I think NickM is doing that too.

Good luck tonight in your club race, you'll still be flying along, even when you're taking it easy. Clairster, keep those feet and legs rested in time for Saturday, you'll be fine, you know the drill. Make sure you text me & let me know how you get on. Hey Ceal, that's just blxxdy fantastic, you go girl!! There's a guy from our club who also runs the masters, usually the 800m & 1500m, he's a MV35, so only just turned vet. Last year he got a bronze at the World Masters Indoor Champs in Poland. Hope you'll be coming away with a medal too, I'm excited for you!!! Looking at that GB flag next to your name must be a great feeling :0). Last night we did a hilly, muddy off road 5 mile run, which was great. It certainly made me puff and blow to start with, but the scenery was good and it was a nice change, so a bit better than doing a lung-buster on the roads. Today is a rest day, as the league race is tomorrow night, a 5 mile undulating course. I actually feel a bit better, so it's probably just what I need. I've also invested in a pair of ""Paula Socks"" (knee high flight socks) to help my tibial muscle, which is still very sore. Not that they look very trendy, but if they do the job, then I'm not bothered. Some of the men commented on them last night, but they didn't fancy wearing the spare pair for some reason. Physio thinks I will need a small orthotic to help the muscle repair itself, without stopping me running, so going back for fitting next week.",3,-2

F: 30mins turbo (bike) intervals; 45mins easy (planned). S: RACE/S. My three 5,000m races this season have all been followed by a 3,000m s/c and have been 16.24, 16.55 (no 'B' competition) and 16.22.

"WTGY - I wouldn't run speedwork by HR although it can be useful to look at the stats afterwards, e.g. to see how well HR is falling off over different recovery times, etc. Recovery runs and long runs I aim to stay &lt;75% max. With other stuff it depends what the purpose of the run is, e.g. a complete run at 'marathon pace' (something approx to your Wednesday run?) might be around 85% max, or a tempo run @ around 90% with warm-up and cool down. FWIW, % max I've seen for races have typically been: mara 86%, HM 88%, 10k 93%, although that all went out of the window with my last HM where I averaged HR (182) same as my last 10k (?!) I think I've found HR useful to keep an eye on for trying to keep a steady pace, but without relying on keeping to some pre-planned level. I like to think I pay less attention to it as I get better pacing by perceived effort.

I followed the Advanced Marathoning 18 week up to 50 mile schedule in 2006 and improved my FLM pb from 3:16 to 2:56. In 2007 I did the 18 week up to 70 mile schedule and did 2:50. This year I'm planning on doing the same as 2007 with two changes. I'm going to try and run the last 5 miles of my long runs at marathon pace (6:17) to try and improve my ability to maintain speed towards the end of a race and I'm going to do tempo runs instead of track work. I'm aiming to go sub 2:45 which I reckon I would have been pretty close to last year if it hadn't been so hot. I've found the above schedules easy to follow. They are almost two easy in that very few of the sessions are high intensity and I always panic that I'm not doing enough. However come the big day they have the desired effect. If I get a sub 2:45 I'm going to jack in the training and run my last marathon in 2009 off the elite start dressed in a huge Scooby Doo outfit. That should guarantee me a slot on the telly!,2,-2

Anyway, just popping into this thread to give my details for the support group . Forum name: annajo . Name (suggest you email this if unhappy to divulge via the forum) Anna . Race number 10386 . Estimated time to mile 17 somewhere between 3-3.5 hours (aiming for a sub 5) . What you'll be wearing Green macmillan vest with 'anna' on the front, over a t-shirt (probably black long sleeve) and black leggings . Any special needs* tell me how great I'm looking, even though I'll be looking knackered! apart from that I should be ok, I'm carrying the equivalent of the kitchen sink with me!",2,-3
Aha - you're right Judderman. My head is very kind and knows i am running for charity. I too am planning on doing Penny Lane. I have the entry form in my briefcase that i printed out yesterday at work!! Might even manage Waterloo 15k which is May Bank Holiday but only 3 weeks after FLM so will have to see. Will enter it on the day probably. Will do Penny lane though as my target is to get speed back this summer over 5-6 milers.,3,-1

"morning all. sounds like some good running going on again now. I'm feeling a bit like Mr Blobby for some reason, but will hopefuly get back in to it soon. Cruisin. good to see you back, and a huge well done for raising that amount. Fantastic. Tutu. my PB for 2008 flm was around 31 mins improvement. Bound to be someone with a better one i guess? . I was dead chuffed with my time 'till i found out a 67 year old in my running club, beat me by 3 mins, with a 3 .42. That bought me down to earth with a bump!",3,-2

"Didds - Having said that a sub 3:40 at Abingdon is quite appealing!! (Umbongo slaps himself round the face for having such silly ideas). My targets for the rest of the year are sub 1:40 half, sub 45 10k (and then as close to 40mins as I can). I have my first club 10k next week which will be my marker and then they do one in July and one in August. The July one will be my sub 45min race and the August will be to get as close to 40mins as possible. I am down to do Windsor half in Sept (the same day as New Forest half!). I am booked in for my London to Oxford bike ride in July (may see Wabo there or not). I read the RW article on Lance Armstrong and quite like the idea of combining cycling into my running training blah blah blah",3,-2

A lot can change in a week. Having bailed 2 attempts at a 10m PMP run last week I nailed one last night to the point that it became a long tempo run rather than PMP. 10.38m in 73:30 = 7:05mm pace. Was half tempted to carry on to try to log an unofficial HM PB as this is 10s per mile inside my current HM PB pace and was still feeling strong. Ave HR 160. Very pleased. Not sure what was different. I am transistioning into new trainers at the moment - most of last weeks running was on old ones with c 700m on them so extra cushioning may have helped but I think the biggest difference was just generally feeling up for it and wanting to get things back on the right track. The other factor may be that I had had about 3 weeks running mostly off road hilly routes culminating in Borrowdale leading upto last week's training so have had to readjust to running faster on the flat again. Anyway - feeling more positive again so I 'll enjoy it while it lasts. Steady 5.5m this morning and hoping to squeeze in a cheeky visit to the track on the way home tonight which would make for a rare double. . CG - get well soon and don't try to fight it. I had 10 days off with some sort of lurgy/man-flu in March. It was right at the time my training for FLM should have been peaking but I just didn't feel like running so I didn't (was also v busy at work at the time). I'm sure I limited the damage by resting rather than trying to run through it.,3,-3
"Yep, Ady, Yogs is def running with a ballot place. Well done FP - another bod to cheer along the Mall! Err, sorry lads, not doing Beachy - like I said earlier, too much carp in my life. ticking along with about 3 runs a week at the moment just to keep a (very) low level of fitness - and it clears my head a bit from all the rubbish that SSWFW puts in it! x",3,-2

"Great race report Tutu sounds like fun. Might have to give it a go sometime. As for Guy Fawkes, I didn't do it. I've not run more than 10 miles yet since hurting my back so I decided togive the race a miss. Ended up at the Metro Centre all day looking at prams and other baby stuff instead. Got out for 9.5 miles last night, really slow and I've not yet recovered my ability to run up hills as I had to stop a couple of times on the really steep one close to home. I know that when I can run up it without stopping then I'm back to full fitness. . It an early bonfire party tonight with fireworks etc (No idea why it's done a day early in Bishop Auckland but it is) so it cross training in the gym at lunchtime with a couple of miles on the treadmill. Ozy",3,-3

"I'm backing off a bit this week after last week's big week. Niggles are niggly, especially yesterday when I had to drive to Maidenhead and back for a meeting. Worse for my legs than anything else - struggled through a recovery run in the late afternoon. RICE last night and my legs are a lot better, but I don't have the work window today to do the planned 14 mile run (lunchtime and evening meetings), so I'll fit in a 6-8 mile run at some point in the day. Work is going to be very hectic in the next few months, as the charity I run is merging with another(larger) one. Loads of meetings, documents, due diligence, lawyers, accountants, etc. etc. ontop of my normal job. Should all settle down by the end of April - thus potentially ruining my whole training plan for London. We'll see. . Welcome mp , there's some good stuff in this thread, but a lot of other stuff to plough through to get to it - 8 hours might be optimistic! By my calculations that's about 40 posts a minute to read. Marigold - nice to hear you're reentering the land of the living. I reckon I've been virus-free for 10 days now, which might be a record for the last 6 months!",2,-3
"I think all the quick treadmill running is definitely an indication of frustration of plodding through snow! If it goes ahead I think conditions wise wokingham will be the complete opposite of last year. It was as close to perfect conditions as I think I have run in. Oh well, PBs all round? And claim an extra min or 2 on the old pugometer! ;-)",3,-3
"Sue C wrote . MM - you know an awful lot about cycling! Do you have a background in the sport? Yes :) I still consider myself a cyclist even though I do more running these days than cycling. I got into cycling 20 years ago through the excitement of the best Tour de France ever won by Greg Lemond and have followed it ever since. Done a fair bit of racing but time constraints since my daughter was born have caused me to take up running to keep fit - bizarrely doing marathon training is easier (timewise) with a family than trying to train for time trials or road races. . Caterpillar Girl - v jealous of the fact you've got your 5 x longest runs done already. I' ve got another LSR planned tomorrow (weather permitting) but I'm building up over the next 11 weeks to get them all in rather than getting them done early on. PMP - I'm with XPS on this one. I try and fit in 1 x PMP pace run of an hour every two weeks to 'practice' running at target pace but my take on it is that you should do varied runs throughout the week to work on all aspects of your fitness - LSR, PMP, intervals to develop your VO2 Max, recovery runs. The only thing missing (at present) in my weekly schedule is a medium length run of 10-13 miles but this is something I am planning on introducing to increase my miles shortly.",2,-2

Just need to;. - Work out how to get from Pen xxx to Pen 1 as the number is 10,xxx. - Pick my moment to mention to other half?? - Work out where to stay or travel early morn. - Start worrying about the weather.

"pizzaman. Cheers for the encouraging words! I did my 1:26 half marathon in 2001 and ran FLM that year with an injured friend which meant finishing in 4:31 to make sure the slacker finished! I'm keen to see what I can do at the Fleet half since i ran a 10km PB three weeks ago and training has been going well since then. I take your point about the pacers - I'll try and use them as a 'ceiling' for a 3:15 finish. A further concern is that I think I'll be in the 3:30 pen at the start and it might be a bit of a battle to find my way to the 3:15 pacer. .

Someone at my club suggested it might have just knotted up when I started tapering - fingers crossed. carbo loading - i am slowly increasing the carbs but trying to take on some protein as well to help with the healing - lots of tuna and mackeral! I am trying to take on enough water as well but do feel a bit dehydrated so moving on to energy drinks from tomorrow. ,2,-2
"Bad luck Adam - find a good physio, mine suggested it was my greater trochanter muscle and lower back and hip joint inflammation. She gave ultrasound/TENS machine type thing/back & hip massage and loads of stretches and core stability exercises. 2 weeks of no running just swimming and 4 physio sessions sorted it out completely. Anyway, you couldn't have done 13 miles without training, at least hold on to that. You'd have done a great half-marathon. What about the Loch Ness Marathon?

"Hi All. Fairly quiet on the thread at the moment, like I have been myself a bit really. Ran home from work last night, usual 7 mile route, which was quite enjoyable, as it had stopped raining by then and was warm. I've realised that some days you just feel good, like you're flying along (like Ashley) and some days it's just not going to happen and I've had quite a few of those lately. 2 weeks ago I had a good day and finished the same route over 2 mins quicker, even by not even really trying, so I think your body has natural ebbs and flows of energy, it's just getting it right. Tonight I'm back at the club and we have planned a recce run of the last 10K inter-club league race, which is a week today. This should be fun, as it's got some sharp hills in it apparently, just hope I can hang onto the mens pack. Tomorrow I will probably run a 13-miler from work, then Saturday is rest day and Sunday is Track & Field. Training seems to be all over at the moment, due to various races and leagues, but will get it right. I'm thinking of doing Newark Half Marathon on 8th August (instead of Darlington 10K) which I had planned, has anyone run this before or know anything about it? Hope you are all flying and looking forward to the weekend races, if you have anything planned. Cheers. Sarah :0)",3,-2
Very interesting Smashy - I'm amazed that you think the course/conditions could make 13 minutes of difference (assuming Paula is in 2:15 shape given perfect conditions) - it must be an absolute stinker of a course.

A chum picked up my number for me so I have got that and my championchip etc etc. Bag is now packed ready with all stuff I need for FLM, got my extra layers to wear at the start plus bin bag, so any of you that I meet at the Clarendon you will have to excuse me for looking like a dork but it will all be peel off throwaway gear!! Transport is deffo free ladies, just need to flash yer number! Going for an early night now (with my nytol which worked last night!), trying to get as much rest in now as I am sure I won't sleep very well tomorrow and Sat. Expo cheapskates - my cereal bar in the goody bag is out of date!! Keep smiling folks. TS. ",2,-1
"I think that whatever marathon you enter you have to approach it with the knowledge that every marathon is different for various reasons....location, size of event, sponsorship etc. Of course the bigger the event the greater the likelyhood the crowd support will be but ofcourse the FLM is a league unto it's own. In regards to future training...there is a wealth of information on the internet and on this RW site for marathon training depending on what time you want to achieve. The easiest way to find a training schedule is to 'google' ""marathon training schedules"" and choose one that works for you. Jamie, .the key to keeping your legs going on a bit longer is those long traning runs....getting a few 20 milers under your belt will help in addition to fine tuning your carbohydrate loading, wearing a good pair of running shoes etc etc. The FLM is a fantastic marathon but it isn't the only one ! There are plenty of other great marathons out there for you to enjoy. Happy running !",4,-1
"well I dont ""run"" them do i. If you had been asked to walk 26 miles twice-well you could yeh?",1,-2
"Hi specky. Sorry to hear about your back. What did you do? . Shame about Robin Hood. I've just completed my first week's running post FLM and managed to do 17 miles which isn't too bad going. Going to try a long run tomorrow, not sure how far to go as I think my legs will feel it. I'm dithering about how to approach my training now. Blackpool in 7 weeks, then a 10k the week after and another 10k the week after that. Glutton for punishment or what!",2,-2

"Brilliant result GG - many congratulations and may you be celebrating in style! Had a friend staying this weekend so was planning on taking the whole weekend off, but did manage to fit in a quick run this morning - bit of a blast with a couple of good hills and nice to get outside as so much of my running these days is just on the treadmill at lunchtime. Must say, running outside really is far more enjoyable by far and as Beders points out (good long run by the way), it is necessary to get used to running on hard surfaces. Spent the rest of the day shifting stuff to/from the rubbish dump in anticipation of moving to a smaller place in London and now I ache all over, so not sure what state i'll be in to do any running tomorrow! BM - do you recommend the total immersion book? was thinking about getting it as keen to learn breast stroke and then my ""challenge"" to myself post hong kong marathon is to learn butterfly (looks like a great workout!). Hope the XC went well Sarah - thought of you today, as it's like a mud bath down in kent at the moment and i almost got stuck on my way back when i cut through the back of the park and did the 100yards off road. Not as cold as it has been, but still chilly enough that I ran in tights, 2 tops and jacket + hat, gloves, scarf today. Welcome Boing and David - the more the merrier ...make sure you join in the chat and banter and let us know what you're up to and no need to lurk :)",4,-2
Found the thread...,1,-1
I've just signed up for a few races too - Taunton half and Fulfords Five in Exmouth. I want to do the Bideford half in March but there isn't anything on the website at the moment and the Braunton 10 - ditto. If I've got a few races to look forward to early in the year it'll keep me motivated. Haven't run in a race since Torbay 10K in August - shameful!,2,-2
"Hi everybody first reply so please don't shout, I have been following some of this and just to add my view I did a few 16 mile runs to and from work about 3 weeks before I ran the Cardiff marathon last year. I knocked 12 mins off my PB now 3.14. I found doing 2 runs in a day gave me a lot of confidence. I am now aiming for 3.05 at FLM 06.",2,-1

"Diana I have a 20 year old daughter who is single but as you know she is in Australia. I am not keen on asking folks for money either but its amazing how generous some folks can be, once on a meal out with friends, I wasn't having much to drink as I was doing RFL the next day, at the end of the evening I was unexpectly given �50 as a donation for the race and I never even asked for it. I have club speed session tonight and hopefully a 16 miler at the weekend. .",3,-2

"Karen Hancock. Hi! I think I saw you (plus a couple of others) running past my house (Canberra Road) this morning (11:10 am). Looked like you were giving it some wellie! Made me feel a bit dispirited as I guess you were nearing the end of your long run and I was just doing my pre-run stretching session, with 21 hilly and muddy miles ahead of me! Still, I'm back now and feeling quite good, having done what I had planned.",3,-2
"Cheers, Andy! I was a runner in distress!!",3,-2
Saqib - good luck for the weekend! I keep meaning to go onto your charity page and donate - will do soon. Let us know how you get on - we want a full run down! Orient - good luck tonight. Hope you get some good news soon. Good news! I've lost 2lbs already - only another 12 to go!,4,-1
Hi HH & SDI. Thanks for the replys. Mrs J did the pengiun plan for her first LM & came in at 5:25 just 2 mins after the pacer. He stopped for a toilet break at 8 miles so she did the rest on her own and never saw him overtake. In the mag I received today it says they do usually 7m/ml up to 12m/ml in min intervals so hopefully they'll do an 11m/ml which is what she wants. It says to preregister go to this website so I'll have a look around. . Thanks again for trying and good luck all. (Beginning to feel a little jealous though have bigger fish this year.). Regards. JT,3,-2
Littlemiss -. Well done on your first 10 miler! Your next goal should be to enter a half marathon as soon as convenient. If you've done 10 in training you're nearly there. You'll be amazed how much more confident you'll be about the marathon once you've got your first half under your belt. And running in a race will give you a little idea of the atmosphere on FLM day! Good luck!,3,-1
"hi all,. I just want to wish everyone the best of luck with your training and the marathon. Much to my dissapointment and frustration I think I need to drop out. . :-(",3,-3
"TTM I hope I have a similar experience as my 10k pb is currently over 44 mins, and I don't plan doing one before FLM, but I hope (expect! my HM pb is actually quicker per mile than my 10k pb) I could improve it. I have found my achilles seem to suffer as my shoes wear out. Recommend running off road, as the knackered cushioning has less detrimental effect. Mind you, if you live in London this might not be so easy . . Can't advice on Brooks or Saucony shoes, tried neither.",2,-2
"Yeah just looked at 2005 results, maybe I should hope for number 23 in 23rd place? Might be more realistic! Took a quick look at 2004 results, field was a bit slower that year so top 10 might have been achievable!! Not sure what the weather was like that year though?!",2,-2
"Wilde Rover, you wont get anything until March when you get the next magazine, I assume just like everyne else. When I ran for a charity I got the app form and youre in magazine from them and then anything else came from FLM but as I say not till sometime in March.",1,-2

Nevermind, it's all back to normal in Delia world now so I'm back and not going to be writing the dreary things I would have otherwise!! I'm so glad to hear that you're all doing so well. I can't wait to hear all of the race reports after the big day! I was talking to someone at work today about my FLM experience last year and now I'm horrendously jealous of you all for being the lucky ones doing it this year!! Nevermind, I'll just have to get my PB at Stratford (aka Hippo's B'day mara!)in May instead! PS I totally agree that Mr Beckham was looking scrumptious on Wednesday evening....oh how I love him!! ;o)",4,-2
"Rowan - great time today, Hogmonster you too mate - must have ran a similar course to me. Gazza brilliant - I am in awe of you all. I am obviously on the wrong theread if I can only manage 3:54 for 20 so I will not bother you again and slip off to the sub 4 thread. But I will not give up and this race will not beat me. I will be back. Thanks for the encouragement and good luck all",4,-2
"Morning,. How are you? It went really well! Weather was good,the support from the crowd was amazing for a half marathon. I ran 1:54 by my watch, so was quite pleased considering the fisrt 5 miles are all up hill!! On the whole felt good and was glad I entered, broke up the training, was a nice change and with the hills you could class it as a long training run I suppose. .

Hello guys and gals . I have a straight back now but must rest for two more days as a pulled a back ligament had caused the problem in the first place . Light 2 or 3 miles saturday then easy 20 at the stroke run on sunday I hope . Still 5 days of rest might help re charge the batteries for chasing T&T Man at Paddock Wood in a weeks time ??? Thanks for the support everyone,3,-2
Thanks Fenn. Decided to put something in there that was more inspiring for me! I sprinted for the last 300 yards or so on Sunday. In my head I had a big grin on my face but it doesn't look like it from the photo. My son said that if I had that much left in me by the end I should have run at a faster pace throughout the race. He admitted that he might be wrong when I had stopped punching him.,3,-2
Always Aching. We seem to be in the same boat. I was after 3:30 but also will be v. happy to get 3:40 and a new PB. But this bl**dy cold better hurry up and shift. Also got a new pair of shoes to wear in (Mizuno Elixir..nice). Great running everybody not long to go before the taper,3,-2
"Aber, that's some kind of cross training you've got going there, not sure my legs would take kindly to any high or long jumping. BFB & Rob, good luck with the long runs, nice and steady does it and leave some good recovery days in the schedule afterwards. SB, sorry to hear you've been ill, maybe a sensible decision to lower your horizons, hopefully you can enjoy the race with less pressure and still get that big new PB. NL, I've been doing all my mid to long runs in some Nimbus that Mrs H bought me for Christmas and I thought they were really heavy to start with, my marathon shoes will be Mizuno Precisions, mostly phsycological I know but they feel much 'faster'!! Last 'big' speed session yesterday 8 x 800m fast off 90 secs jog recoveries, averaged 3:03 per rep, with a couple of warm up/warm down miles total just over 7 miles. Last medium long midweek tonight 12 or 13. Keep well now everyone.",3,-2

And now it's free! Anyway must go - I have to write up all the things I learnt this morning before I forget them and can no longer ready my handwritting!",2,-1
"LW5, FLM06 was my first marathon and I couldn't believe how exhausted how felt for weeks. I'm gradually getting back in to my running now but if you're struggling try introducing walk breaks as this will have a mental benefit as much as anything esle. If you're running for, say, 5 minutes, stop and walk for one minute and then do the same again all the way to the end of your run. You can eliminate the walk breaks once you've fully recovered or take less of them if you've got used to the strategy and its advantages. At FLM06 I walked for 1 minute at the end of each mile up to 20 so even towards the end I could still keep going by saying ""only 9ish more minutes until my next break"" - I ran without breaks after mile 20. I recovered much quicker because of this strategy and I'm still using it now. I ran 3 miles 3 days after FLM, with walk breaks, of course! Give it a try and see if it helps. best of luck.",3,-2
Pinks speed sessions are usually pretty much flat out bursts of up to 1/2mile 90-95%HR. A tempo session is a more sustained speed session up to 1 1/2hrs. These are done at about 85-90% of maximum HR.,1,-1

"GD - just doing 13.1M in this heat is an achievement. I got up really early to run my 12M, Started really slow as legs felt a little heavy after yesterdays hill session,then picked up the pace a little, felt nice and easy, came home in 1:34 (av 7:50). Started cool, ended very hot, took on almost 1.5 litres, and have been drinking ever since.",3,-2

"TMR:. I agree with the not blasting off statement you made regarding XC races. In the local sunday league races, last season I blasted off with the leaders and by the end of the race was holding on. I then ran the bigger xc races such as the Southerns (Mike Gratton will remember that one!) and the Nationals at parly Hill. I started off very steady in these races, let my eager team mates shoot off in front, then spent the whole race, slowely picking off runners, in fact I overtook all my team mates and made up around 50-60 odd places and finished feeling pretty strong as well!",3,-2

Mike, out of interest are your schedules suitable for all levels of runner or do you need to have a background of a few years running at a reasonable mileage first? I'm planning to start your marathon schedule at the beginning of Dec after a goal 10k race. Would I be following exactly the same plan as last year and also should I expect to be starting from a slightly higher level and be seeing slightly faster paces on my steady and LT runs? At present I'm running steady paced runs at around 7.50 pace on a mildly undulating course.",2,-2
Nothing gone from my account either. Although a cheque for �40 which was highlighted yesterday is now not highlighted - I take it any transactions that should go out today would be highlighted now and there arnt any so that means nothing going out of my account today me thinks (why are my posts so complicated!?).

"Hi, MN :o) Welcome! Stick around and see what you think .. when the thread started, not all that long ago, I'd never done a sub-2hr half-marathon. HRR, I must confess that I'm not drinking any more than usual. Not because I'm genetically half-cactus like the person who wrote the rambling letter to that effect in the current RW, but because my fluid intake is quite generous anyway and because I don't sweat enormously. And before a long run, I carbo-load so well that there's probably enough water bound up with the glycogen in my legs to keep me going. At this time of year I only take drinks on runs lasting over two-and-a-half hours. Obviously it's different in summer.",3,-1
"Hi DM/All. you are spot on about the club situ,I was with a club,now moved up to the hills and became slower, now that l run by myself. Can l ask those people that are following a schedule,how comes they are doing so much milage above the weeks sessions.Do they benifit from the extra milage?/what sessions do they add it too and finally, have they put in their schedules befor and benefited from it all? .

Thanks Bowi. How do i know if i have the seat at the right height? when my leg is in the most extended position should it be completely straight or slightly bent? also if i am doing it for cross training do i have low resistance and go faster or is it better to have higher resistance or is it just about doing a certain distance in a certain time? i did 5 miles in 21 minutes.,2,-1
"A from E. Wonderful! best nights sleep ever-counting sheep.My uncle farmed sheep in the Bowland area-I recall him counting in this way. LSR 15 miles then 10 mile race next week.

Mine is planned as 24, 16 & 10 (about 10 days out) which also includes a 10K race and speedwork on a weekly basis. Ideally 3 weeks is good, but it can be done on 2 if you taper more sharply. . DFD, thanks for the taper article - a good read. Not long til Boston now! Keep of the grapes. CL, I would go for the 3 mile race, it will be a nice sharpener and you can use it as speedwork. I personally think higher mileage weeks are the key to a faster time, particularly when you've reached a plateau like I have in my last 3 marathons. You seem to be doing just fine. Ceal, well that's just blxxdy fantastic!!! What a great time, I'm so pleased for you, it must be a fantastic boost coming into FLM too - all those great miles training and now this - yipee! LoR, welcome back, sounds like a good plan to me and you're on target. LF, that sounds like a good idea - an Easter Bunny outfit - might be a bit hot at Hamburg with it on though. I didn't have a good time at training on Thurs night either on the track, so just kept it steady, felt crxp. Beders, the canal run sounds great, what a different good company can make, wish I'd come with you guys now, but there was no way I could've made it time-wise. You were all flying along, sounds like you were doing cartwheels at the end. I found I felt stronger from 20 miles on too, hopefully it's a good omen. Hobble, sounds like tired legs and let's face it, we are all bushed at this time in our training. Don't be too down about it, as you've put in some great training times lately. Ozzy, good to hear you are nearing a full recovery & you're tootling along at 8 min miling again, which isn't that fast for you. Text me and let me know if you'll be there on Friday, when you make a decision. Clairster, well done on your LSR too, we all seemed to hate it apart from Beders & Co. I too ground to a big halt when the Garmin bleeped at 24 miles, which I think was more mental than physical. I went home and slept for 1.5 hours after that, cold and LSR wiped me out. . NickM, catch up with you Thurs as re-arranged for race on Fri morning. Let me know if you fancy doing 15-16 miler together at MP over same weekend. I also received a �20 voucher for ""Up & Running"" in the mail on Sat, which was a nice surprise - a prize from last week's Ackworth HM.",5,-2

"DoT - I think it's the same, but I don't look back in races so have never seen his face. He generally beats Ronnie O'Sullivan, his local celeb rival in the Essex scene. The results are up already. It seems that most people are 40 - 50 seconds down on last year. Two members of Coronium 's club who went sub 33 last year were about a minute up this time. The winner seemed to have a very good race for 32:44. The guy closest to me (who beat me by 6 seconds) has bagged a couple of decent HMs this year. NM2 - it's a great site, set up by a club mate (hence the inclusion of my times from the days when 33:35 was more like my 5M time).

I expecct to hit the start line a couple of pounds heavier than for FLM07, but should be about the same weight as when I ran Abingdon last year. My main worry is cramp, but I have a cunning plan in place to avoid that, courtesy of my Triple Iron Man clubmate. He acted as a pacemaker at Abingdon, and watched me suffer on the way round. I'll be taking what he takes to stop it. Hopefully it should work. 7.30pm?!!!!!! Not confirming anything.",3,-2

"LF, congrats on your new job, once you've been sat at a desk for a few hours, you'll be bursting with energy and itching to get your trainers back on. Great run at a cracking pace, the previous run was obviously your body having an 'easy day' but I often feel like that. Euph, yes, looking forward to Selby HM, but have another long run (around 12-13 miles) to get in on Friday, then I'll start looking towards the taper next week, with some strides and shorter sessions. I'm hoping it won't be too windy, unlike today, when I've almost been blown off my feet. Where is Haltemprice btw? Was looking at your list of 10K races, as trying to find a good 10K course. Ceal, thanks for your comments, now that it's getting towards the XC season, I'm having to look a bit harder for 10K on the road with a good course, hopefully I'll find one soon, as don't have one planned at the moment. DFD, the mental images which your post conjured up were just mad, you take it easy on those step ladders and running to school - don't want any non-running induced injuries on the thread! Could you please impart some of your mental pre-race strategies, as I'm really interested. Eddie, welcome back, you've been very quiet over the summer and will no probably steam in with a marathon PB at Leicester. Ozy, great run last night and it's even better when you've run that far - you feel justified in eating as much food as you like, well done. Clairster, that sounds like an excellent session, which turns out to be even better when you've run at a pace like that and didn't even realise it. LS, now you know you can achieve anything, no barriers, no mental obstacles, sub 1.40 awaits in your next HM. Have you got a Garmin? Stick to the pace like glue if you have. Did a pretty hard session on the track last night with the club, which was 16 x 1 min efforts, with a decreasing recovery, so first rest period was 45 seconds, then 30, then 15, then 1 min, repeated 4 times. Just when we thought we'd finished, we had 500m jog recovery, then ran 1000m, which I didn't do at full pelt, as would probably have crocked myself, but still managed 3.57, which wasn't too bad at the end of a work-out. Today is windy as hell here, the trees are bending in half. I think wind is one thing I hate the most as a runner. Rain, snow, sun, etc I can cope with, but wind is very energy-sapping, the only thing worse is when it's combined with rain or snow. 4 miles at lunchtime at a fairly steady pace. Plenty of races at the weekend, with the biggies including GNR & Berlin Marathon.",4,-2

"I do like a good debate and it looks like I've missed a few good ones on here today. I've got a new run plan I'm moving into, moving things on from 4 to 5 runs per week in the next month. Most of my mileage on weeknights is with club due to increased work hours, so I'm going to take advantage this winter by doing as many miles at the weekend as I can. Tuesday &ndash; Club Night &ndash; as with PPB's varies but with slower talking pace at the start culminating in hard surges at the end. A few regroup stops so I consider this an easy session. Wednesday - Short, easy. The run I'm most likely to dump. . Thursday &ndash; Club speedwork, tempo run or fartlek with the fast group. If not the club then I'll do tempo or intervals. Saturday &ndash; At this time of year this is my 'have some fun run'. One of only two weekly opporutunities to run in the light. Trail, hills, maybe both, but not too hard. Sunday &ndash; When I'm not racing this is LSR day. In marathon training last time I was anywhere between 20 miles early on to 50 later in my plan - tended to bounce between 35-45 as would only do a 15m+ LSR once every two weeks. My average for the last two complete months before marathon month was 160, so roughly averaging 40 mpw. I've never run monthly mileage that high before or since. I think I needed to run 20m in a run and then get another 20 in through marathon-paced or other sessions each week. Its what I needed to run a good marathon at Windermere. I also went out my way to run hilly routes which built my confidence for tackling an undulating/hilly marathon. Do the same for FLM and you'll be quids in as you'll have energy to burn on the long flats of the FLM. This time I want to do more, I've planning to hit average 30+ mpw by December, and 40 by mid January. My plans involve over marathon length races so I may try and push on beyond 50mpw on occasions. Like Nick I'll ramp down a week occasionally. Nick - Glad you enjoyed (endured?) Bishop Wilton, if anybody ever tells you East Yorks is flat you can now force-feed them their empty-words :) . That hill to the east of Bishop Wilton is mean, as mean as the one at GF10 but without paving to get grip from! That was the significant hill at our XC there - I also found a few boggy bits. Oddly the rest of the course was easier than this weeks at Drewton Woods nearer Hull, but that one hill took enough out of everyone to make the rest of the course a painful affair. Bounding back down it at the end wasn't fun either, the sort of steep, bumpy, uneven descent only Beders could enjoy ;-)",3,-2
"AH - great news re. Paris, just need to get your hip sorted out now. At present I plan to do all 3 marathons (I have done 2 in a month before and felt OK) -friend did London and Stratford last year and he is in his 60s and he managed 4:20 and 3:57. He ran London with his son and because it was a training run and no pressure, he really enjoyed it. My plan is to treat two of them as training runs and one as a serious PB attempt. On the basis I am not a Paula and doubt that I will be digging deep into my last reserves in any of the runs I should be able to recover easily enough (who am I kidding) - Plodding Hippo does them all the time so why not -aim is to get up to 10 and then retire.

"Week Seven Day Three Wednesday . My Schedule says 7M (approx 56 mins) steady. My Timex says 7M in 56. 40 . . . It didn't feel steady on the tready :( as I said earlier I tried to focus on ' running tall ' and keeping my trunk stretched. The pain in my butt ock diminished quickly and I tried to stare at one particular point on the wall in front of me and ran towards it . . . I kept my form for about 6M but the last mile was a real struggle and I couldn't keep the right body shape. But I got there. Splits all around the 8m mark apart from the first and last . . . I can feel the pain in my butt ock again now and I know that no matter how I sit it's going to hurt to stand up, but once I'm in motion again it gets better. In the morning I'm going to play around with the seat in my car because I suspect the settings have been changed whilst it's been repaired and then serviced during the past fortnight. I've never understood why people who work on cars never ever return the seat to the position they found it in when they got in . . it's one of my soapbox topics! grrrrr . . :( . I have a new problem . . on Monday night during the hills I clipped a kerb with my right foot and almost fell over. I think I must have jarred my big toe because I woke up last night and it was throbb ing and it's doing it again now. It's a funny colour too. After the Miami Marathon which Trin and I did last January this particular big toe went a funny colour and the nail died . . and in fact it took about 48 weeks to fully grow back again. The last time that happened to me was after I broke a big toe but I don't think I did that in Miami. But it's not happy at all at the moment . . :( . I had planned to run 5M tomorrow, this being the run I didn't do last Saturday when I brought this week's runs forward by 24hrs. However in the light of my currrent aches and pains, and because I have no idea when I'm going to get home tomorrow evening, I'm going to take tomorrow as a Rest Day and have 2 days off in a row.

Big welcome to the new folks .. as the saying goes 'you don't have to be mad to post on here, but it helps :-) ). Beders, that sounded like a really tough run on Saturday. no wonder your legs were knackered afterwards. A few days in the sun will help no doubt ;-) . Well done on getting the 16 miler nailed Crazy Lady, the wind is a toughener isn't it? Not to mention a pain in the arse! Wow, Little Stoker, 3:20 on your feet, brilliant stuff and quite rightly a massive confidence booster. . I absolutely loved your reports of the Trollers race Clairster/Euph. It brings back thoughts of the Osmotherley Phoenix, which was such a blast last year. Brilliant running by both of yu too. So glad you had a great run Clairster, you deserve that after (by your standards) a bit of an indifferent start to the year. Onwards and upwards! Congrats to the Chelsea plodder family for a very productive outing on Sunday. Moggie - wey-hey ...absolutely stonking performance. Did you win a prize with that time?? I think we all probably understand about running the race in your mind .. definitely more than half the battle IMHO. A great great run, and probably a thread record too.

Wondering if i could have a bit of advice from Steve if possible? I'm due to do the Bath Half at the weekend, though the schedule says 18M - should i go for a few miles before / after and do it at slow pace / marathon pace depending on how i'm feeling, or should i be happy just doing the 1/2? I'm not going to go all out again as doing that in the Berkhamsted 1/2 meant i had trouble running properly all week with very heavy legs. Thanks very much!",4,-2

Then drop to 26 miles for the following week (including 2 rest days and a 12X400 blast on the Tuesday). This is a result of finding the running a lot easier this year&hellip;probably because I have run, and got used to putting in, a lot more slower miles (i.e. 7.30/8.00mm).

"People who have multiple partial entries, I wouldn't worry too much. If you read the pages you would have seen that multiple entries will make all void UNLESS DUE TO TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. If you've got two entries where you've filled in all details including payments, and got confirmations for both, then worry. If you've only gone part way through before it crashed then I should think you'll get sorted in the end, even if it's a pain. I guess in such cases they'll automatically delete entries with only partial information. They are not going to count an entry without payment details are they? . Someone asked if they were registered if they were getting a message that their email had been used for a registration. My guess is if you didn't get past that page probably not (or at least only a partial, see above). It's possible they are using cookies: little files that say you've visited a page that are stored on YOUR computer. If so in some cases people could be getting this message but FLM has no record on their system of your visit: it's all on yours. Personally as I've got a confirmation from Worldpay I reckon I've got some proof, and I'm letting things die down a bit before I get onto them. I think if I had not got either email and I hadn't got to the payment stage then I'd probably try again, and sort out multiples later if it came to that. But without definitive advice from FLM I guess everyone needs to make their own mind up what's best to do for them.",1,-2

"Evening all. Fantastic run for me tonight with the club - mostly off road with a few tough hills but managed 7.5 miles at 7.59 pace so really pleased. Especially as legs still feel quite tired from the weekend. At least 3 people commented on the speed I ran - 'someone had their weetabix this morning' etc :-) . HRR - before Paris I had plans A (the very unrealistic by that stage sub-3.45) B (sub-3.50, also unrealistic), C (sub-3.55), D (a pb) and <u> E </u> (sub-4.00)! So I completely understand. I was telling a guy from the Paris forum about how many fallback plans I had the day before and he thought I was ridiculous, said 'what's the different between 3.50 and 3.55?' etc, but I KNOW there's a huge difference - in my crazed mind anyway!! Even though sub-3.55 doesn't 'mean' anything, I would have liked to have got closer to 3.50 than 4.00. I knew it was silly! It was strange, I simply couldn't keep up 3.55 pace at Paris, and yet at London I'm pretty sure I ran 3.50 pace until well after 20 miles! Sorry to start babble about myself, strange how thinking about Edinburgh has been making me reflect about Paris/London so much. Have come to lots of conclusions about both but won't bore you with them. . Will absolutely totally be rooting for you all on Sunday. Remember all your best mantras and mental tricks everyone and run like the wind - with the wind! . AH - I don't remember the wind bothering me that much last year - I was just too busy being grateful that it wasn't hot like London. Do remember a small stretch along the coast when it was worse than other times but nothing too bad, really. .

RB - fat and slow ! I just feel slow. Well done Coro. Brian - get closer to the kerb then ! I did a 5k road race a few years back and squeeked under 18:00 - I remember my legs groaning at the pace though. Don't think I'll be doing another. I've only done 4 races in the past 18 months !,2,-2
"NtS - I know I shouldn't laugh but that is a very funny story. I hope you are ok. Passing out is a serious issue (that goes for Padams as well), take it easy. The only time I have ever come close to fainting was while I was in the operating theatre with MrsC while she was having a c-section. TT - 31M, WTF. It sounds like you are ultra material. Marigold - sorry to hear about your continued problems. I hope you get back to 100% ASAP and get a few more wins. BEJ - wow, that is some serious mileage. 8M 'steady' @ 5:56 m/m today. Still got a bit of a niggle with my thigh. Currently in Toulouse where it is very hot/humid, but hope to get out for a few miles early tomorrow.",3,-2
So what's the cut off time? Do they have cut off times for each leg as well?,1,-1
Nice one Jools. as has been said you can only beat what is there on the day. echo JAP's comments. few beers and bbq to re-dress the balance this evening. certainly nice about the cooler conditions. got lost across Wimbledon common meant only did the 18 and not the 20 I was hoping for. ccnba to add them at the end. . BEJ- 80% @ 5.36 is pretty nice. usual run from CORO!,3,-2
"AH - we fly back tomorrow (and yes, I might pop along to the club night on Tuesday to see about joining). It's been a nice long break but it'll also be nice to be back home. I might also get to see more of the GB olympic competitors, as they won't be featured so much here (although fortunately they showed the women's cycle road race so I saw all the 2nd half of it).

"Brief running history: started 6 years ago when i became a London cabbie just for a bit of exercise.Entered my first race 18mnths ago and have been steadily improving with each race, am nearly 41 and have just clocked 34:31 for a 10k on a rain soaked muddy surface so there is definately more to come.My best half marathon is 1:19, that was in March but i should be a lot fitter now, i train 6 days a week, about 50 miles and have always used Runners World schedules and pace calculators which have been spot on so far. My predicted marathon time is 2:38 which is probably quicker than my cab!! I currently weigh about 8st 7lb so im looking more like a Kenyan by the day!! It would be great to run London i've heard so much about it from other runners, so good luck to everyone who enters this competition.",3,-1
"Ah Tarkers, I fear you are exhibiting a lack of charity and tolerance there. Try running past a football stadium on match day and you will be dodging past fat, pie-eating groups of lads. But, you can't complain. It means all the bigotted, over-aggressive oiks in one place, letting off steam on each other rather than their families and other innocents. . Or, 11am sunday morning past your local church is going to be frustrated by tottering old biddies trying to get into the Lord's good books before it's too late.

"Congrats to the Pug clan! No wonder you haven't posted much recently. Well done to the XC racers. Didn't realise there were lots of county champs today. Ours is next weekend. Done a bit today - 5M easy in the morning, immediately followed by 45 minutes of tennis. Then 8M this afternoon with 4.5M at what Gobi would call tempo lite (5:36 pace). BAC boys - unless one of you tells me otherwise I'll be at the ferry just before 9am tomorrow!",3,-1

"Dad Of Two wrote . Hmmm, so the height / weight thing is still going eh? Well, I'm 5'10' and currently 11st 8lb. Racing weight last couple of years has been around the 11st mark give or take a lb. I'm happy with that, and feel a lot stronger and healthier than I did 20 yrs ago when I had a cycle-racing weight of about 9st 4lb (and I haven't got any taller in the meantime!). I pretty much eat what I want to, and the same with drinking (I like a snifter now and then, but I'm not what some would call a big drinker.). Point is for me that I run to feel good - generally speaking if i run faster I feel better, but if I start to feel that I'm losing all-round strength or that the end (feeling good) is being overtaken by the means (running faster or losing weight) then alarm bells start ringing in my head."". Well we all know my opinion on weight so I'm not going to dig that lot up again, all I know is, I'll be running so much quicker it's untrue when this weight is off. My lungs and legs don't actually feel too bad considering the lack of training.. but when you've got 31lbs of flab to lose, that's alot of minutes for free. Doing 3 weight sessions per week, nothing to build any muscle this time around, just for strength and definition as the weight piles off.. actually, tonight is shoulders/arms followed by an 8 miler down the club.. now where's my lettice leaf? Cheers Pug :)",3,-2

But I'm worried that to get even close to 3.30 I will need to run faster, and for longer, than any of my training runs. Which I can't get my head around! Should I be doing some of my long runs faster? . hope you can reply, many thanks. Ci",2,-2

"HI Steve,My trainers have done 5-6 hundred miles will it be ok to wear new ones and do you think this might eliminate some of the problems? FL I'm not sure what this problem is - it's hard to say, but I,ll be trying my best to get over it. Not sure about running 3 times whilst injured, although I've had similar type of problem after some marathons in the past (but I've always put that down to giving my all during the run). I wasn't right for New York and should in hindsight have pulled out - but if you go all that way - then you got to run !",2,-2

I'm a bit worried about you lot! You're discussing running and the acshual race :-\ Group 7 have moved on from yesterdays discussion on Marmite and why the B pings off my laptop to who needs a good spanking with my hairbursh and Podds' greyhound.

"Well done marmite. What kind of structure have you got to your training at the moment? Well raced BR and Hilly. HH - Good decision to call it if you were struggling, but I'm a bit confused. You say you want to do 32 in a few weeks time, so as I can see it, your rep paces were pretty much spot on? Your rep times to race pace work out as 2000m = 31:55/10k, 1200m = 15:37/5k, 800m = 8:45/3k & 400m = 4:04/1500m. That to me looks about what you should be doing, rather than too fast, or have I missed something? Don't forget it was quite warm y'day as well, so that would have contributed to this feeling harder on top of the track session the day before. TR - hope the run went well. Chin up. There's still another 10 days. Have you gotten it checked out? Try taking some calcium and magnesium supplements. They may help with the spasming. Seriously. wtgy - well done on 3rd. lol @ 'Was trying to remember what proper runners do to drop people' - and what are you then if not a proper runner? coro - I wore the Adizero's for the TT again yesterday. I think they are now my new favourite shoe. They just seem more conducive to faster running. They're a little harder than the Streaks, but that seems to suit me a bit better for faster stuff...... Legs were a little heavy this morning (unsurprising after fartlek on Tuesday and a TT yesterday), so with a 2 hour run coming up this pm I kept my recovery even more gentle than usual. As RB is not around to do his pace police bit, 6m @ 7:48m/m. I think that is the slowest I've run, outside of a cool-down all year.... I'm starting to enjoy my little jogs as my second runs though.",4,-2

By Friday you'll be bursting with energy and feeling 110% fit. Go for the massage by all means, but tell them it's with the FLM in mind.",3,-2

"Need some help and advice, please. Have developed a 'pressure sore' on my heel, at the top of the back of my shoe. What's the best or quickest way to heal this? I've been running in these shoes for about two weeks and they seem fine, hadn't given any sign of rubbing or problems. It was when I walked 5 miles in them that the agravation occurred, it was meant to be a sneaky way of getting the kids some exercise by walking them to their grandparents before running back for the car. I seem to have developed a habit for picking up injuries from non-running activities. Any suggestions for a quick cure? Thanks.",2,-2

All the best for Weds BR. Looking forward to Hilly's 100m race report. Bang and there was the line, should cover it.",3,-2
"My God, the telly this evening must have been even more dull than usual, Matt ! FWIW I ran a 3 minute positive split, so perhaps 1.27 or thereabouts on a warm day is on the money. Who knows. Anyhow, in an effort to add a little more life and excitement into the thread, I present my Hogweed Trot race report. Target was 40.15. 40.26 was the score on the doors and either my pacing was abysmal, their mile markers were out or the wind and (from about mile 4 onwards) heavy rain had more of an effect than I realised. Or two or more/all of the above. Anyway, FWIW, splits were 6.22, 6.47, 6.17, 6.40, 6.14, 6.42, 1.24. 3rd lady and a mug to match last year's plate (also 3rd lady in 2008).",3,-2

I used to have to leave at least a couple of hours otherwise I got stitch. For several of my LSRs over the winter I had nothing before going out other than liquids (sports drinks) - I'm trying to get used to haveing at least a light brekkie before I go (just means getting up even earlier !). For daytime sessions I still leave 2-2.5 hours if I can - prefer to feel 'empty' when I run. WEL - just 4 away then........!,2,-2

I know just what you mean tibby - I'm following the runners world schedule to the letter T and its killing me watching my running pals (including my husband!)doing longer and faster runs than me. But the tapering is recommended by experts with years of experience so who are we to argue! Last year after a weeks holiday and no running I ran the fastest 10K of my life so there's something to be said for rested muscles. Good Luck.,3,-3

The congestion was a little frustrating to say the least and i think if i do another marathon it will be a quieter one, where i'll see if i can improve on my time.

"Hi - Thanks to all who responded to my comments placed last week - I receive notifications but somehow I cannot read your responses - shame as some of the help and advise that I have read sounds to be good. Finished Silverstone in 2hrs 4mins, improvement of 4 mins on last year - on target at 10miles and even ran with the 9min mile pacer - but from 11 miles seemed to be treading water........missed a number of mile markers so really please when I saw the 13mile marker and managed sprint to line. 20miles in Morecambe next week trimpell - so hoping for a 3hr 30min target.

In last years Firth of Forth race I had a canoe next to me from about 500m into the race as myself and one other guy were bringing up the rear way adrift of the rest of the masses. It's a great challenge you should give one a try sometime. Just read about your 10K, those km markings were shocking. You may have run a sub-45 race already. Cheers for now. PPB.",3,-2
"Hi All, Just when i had put my thermals away coz the warmer weather had set in i watch the forecast and they tell me there's gonna be snow by the weekend! It's no wonder we've all had colds, flu ,viruses, etc, etc. The wind direction changed suddenly today and the temp dropped 1 or 2 degrees straight away. On top of that i've now joined the injury list with a severe pain on the ball of my left foot right at the base of my middle toe. Feels like i'm walking on a stone all the time. If anyone has anything similar and a remedy i'd be grateful. . Kattysparke, i'll be getting to the expo for registration about 11.30 on 13th, comig up from East Grinstead. Will be travelling up from Three Bridges on 17th if anyone else travelling up from South wants to meet up. Despite injuries and ailments i'm staying positive about the day and really looking forward to it now. Good to see Zimchick and Paul made the RW column. P.s I know somewhere that hires out walking sticks and zimmers should we require them on the day!!!!",2,-3

"Hello all, I'm back!!! UM - I've emailed Meldy, thanks for tracking me down. Can�t have my email working on this site as it�s a work address so I probably shouldn�t really be on these forums ;-). Showboat, sorry to hear about your problems, have you definitely decided if you�re running this year or not? I hope this thread has been of some help to you and maybe you could use it as inspiration for next year. I felt awful having to defer last year but it's been worth it in the end as I�m feeling pretty good now. How�s everyone else doing? Hope you're all tapering nicely without any problems. . It felt so weird on Sunday only doing an hour�s run. This week I�ve got a 40-50 min. run tomorrow, gym session on Wednesday and my final pre-race run on Friday. Going for a gentle 20-30 mins. back over the Scrubs where my training really started last year. I�m going to the Expo on Friday and will try and get there as early as poss. to avoid the rush of out-of-towners. On the other hand I may be so excited that I�ll go after work on Thursday- so impatient! Sorry not to be able to meet up with you Shuffler at the Expo and not sure if we�ll see each other on the day. You�re a bit faster than me but it�s nice to think of you and Sezz being on the same �team� as me. I�ve decided to set myself tasks for each day this week to keep the nerves at bay. Today's task is writing and sending off the last of my letters asking for sponsorship. It�s a bit late but you never know. I�ve found emailing and writing to people direct has been quite effective, nearly everybody has sponsored me and some people have been surprisingly generous. Total is somewhere around �700 excluding Gift Aid and my company will add another �250 in a money match scheme so it�s looking quite healthy. Must go before this email turns into an essay! 5 days to go! :-)",3,-2

"Entirely the wrong strategy I know but ran for 3:15 last night at 75% MHR - covered 23 very easily paced miles. Only a little tightness and tiredness in legs this morning - will get along to FLM Expo this afternoon for leg massage.

"Hi FB - thanks for that. Yes, I'm really looking forward to MB. I'm not much of a climber at all, but did an intro week in the Alps last year, and Mt Aspiring in NZ at Christmas. I'm going with a climbing company in August. Did you travel off your own bat?",3,-1

"It's easy to jump to the wrong conclusions (as I did) - it's been pointed out to me that some runners and marshals sell their medals and jackets, T shirts, caps, jackets etc and donate the proceeds to charity - a club colleague of mine is donating whatever he can get for his staff medal to the Dreams come True Charity. Good for him (but yah boo to any one who is profiting for themselves).",2,-3
"Thanks for the stats, Wardi. Hmmm, there certainly doesn't seem to be any logic at all, especially if the men's qualifying time remains unchanged, despite there being far more men achieving it. This would mean that I'd have to train even harder to get my qualifying time at Berlin in September ;-(",2,-3
"If done correctly, the reason that you gain weight is because you are storing extra glycogen - and glycogen requires water, thus the additional weight gain, which will be drawn upon very quickly through the race. This is also part of the reason you may feel sluggish and heavy at the beginning of the marathon but really good around 10-12 miles, as you have already burnt up some of your stored fuel and are already lighter. Even if you already run off less carbs than you should, you would still benefit from this, as you are trying to encourage your muscles to store more glycogen than normal. There are a few ways of carbo depletion/loading, and one of the common ways of doing it is to have 3 days of lower carbs (I actually take this to extreme) and then do a 3 minute run flat out (after a good warm up) and then 24 hours of eating a very high carb and low protein/fat diet - so in fact, the 6 days fall very clearly into focus on protein/fat for 3 days, 1 day of very high carbs, and 2 days of normal eating. This is less likely to make you feel bloated at the start line. Normally, the distance runner's diet consists of around65-70% carbs, 15-20% protein and the balance fat. In the carb load week, the first 3 days will look more like the atkins diet - loads of protein, then fat, and finally carbs. You will know whether you have done it correctly as on day 3 of the depletion, you will probably feel like the lightest you have ever been - most of this is water loss. It's really important that in the carb phase on day 4 you eat the right amount of carbs, otherwise you will not load sufficiently. As a 56kg woman who normally eats 65% carb diet, this means that in those 24 hours, I will eat roughly 600g of carbs. I won't overeat calorie consumption. That equates to around 2400 cals of carbs. . I have done this as a veggie and it is a lot harder to do it than eating meat. It also is pretty hard if you have a sweet tooth! But it works.",2,-2

"Bedders, don't apologise for wearing different colour specs from me. I've done this race three times, and the start has been delayed each time. Very annoying - I'm with you there. . I've just found that the positives outweigh the negatives, that's all. We tend to major on 'organisation' when we assess races, and of course that's important, but there are other factors to think about. Yes, I remember that there were complaints about the buses but I've always driven there and haven't experienced that myself. The race itself feels like a big event which is why I think it's good preparation for London (insofar as anything can prepare you for London). Bottled water, energy drinks, big field, tons of marshals, good crowd support, town centre running, finish in a high-profile stadium... I've never had any trouble getting my medal or buying a teeshirt. The thing about Reading is I think they genuinely try to improve the event year on year. They keep switching the route and the date to try to improve it, and I respect that.",3,-3
"Some fantastic mileage being run out there, keep it up guys. Just got back from my 20 (ended up doing 22) Very windy on the way back - bit of sleet thrown in for good measure! Managed the run in 2 hours and 56 minutes, probably a bit fast, but felt OK. I used some gels for the first time - SIS orange flavour. Reminded my of sweet semolina, Yum Yum - NOT. Seemed to keep me going though, so I think I'll stick with 'em. I bought a specific waist belt to carry them in, nice and slim, didn't even notice it on the run!

It was a miracle, no knee pain at all and I was doing 10 min miles...I've never run that fast ever! Went back to my normal running style as an experiment for 1 min and knee instantly hurt again. So I'm sticking with this method for London. Can anyone recommend so ok tasting energy gels? Tried the SiS ones and they were disgusting.

"Did the FLM in 2003 and loved it - or rather loved finishing it - said never again and had changed my mind by the following Wednesday. Anyway, after 2 years of rejections (nice watch and a huge rainjacket) I was accepted for this year, and got on with my training. Although I have been quite enthusiastic and the training has been OK, I must admit that it wasn't the same as the first time - I just didn't seem to have the same sense of excitement, which I guess is understandable as I'd wanted to run the marathon since I'd first seen the early races on TV. A good example is that last time I pretty much lived on this forum, whereas this time I was just dropping in and out (and consequently missed the support group stuff - must pay more attention). Anyway, this week the nerves have hit me big time, and I'm really struggling to focus on anything else. I'm trying to be excited as well, but, to be honest am a bit all over the place, and can't really think of much else at the moment. Any non-virgins experienced out there experienced this?

"Ms Raptor, best wishes for Abingdon. I did my now weekly 13.1 mile solo run yesterday, and was slightly peeved that my pacing (without technology) was marginally off and my time was 1hour 47 and not 1:43:30 like last weeks. I guess I've gotten used to always improving my times, but for a training run, I should be happy that it's now a regular thing and not a monumental challenge anymore. The plan for Glen Clova Half is to collar someone of experience who has a bleepy thing so I can attack the 100 mins target ! Pidge, your photo didn't do you justice either. I had you down as a white van man in his forties ! Anyway good luck with Barnes Green. It shouldn't be too hot for you ! Find someone beforehand who plans a similar pace to you and smash your PB when those gazelle genes kick in from mile 10 onwards !! Just don't bring up your job if you like a chat going round ! Ha! Ha! I am gonna experiment with these wee SIS gels that Mr Dap swears by at Glen Clova, if it can give me a wee boost to maintain my pace. HRR, I have big plans for you in the Winter months ahead, so soak your feet in vinegar like a pair of conkers, and fingers crossed you'll be back soon. . Amanda Z, hullo. Good luck in Stroud. Think I've been there when I lived in Bristol. Take it easy and think only of good things, never giving negative thoughts any space in your head. . I've not looked at any training plans yet, feeling that the higher my long run can be come Christmas, the better. I'll have less ground to make up in 2007, so might actually enjoy it, instead of it being the most hellish 12 or 15 weeks of my life ! QQ, does the bloke off Blues Clues on Nick Jnr still sing the Bedtime Business song at 7pm ? A classic !

"Hi all (changing subject). Totally gutted today as actually DROPPED OUT of my 5K race after 1K. Started strong then unbelievably right hamstring cramped out...pretty much out of the blue. I stopped and stretched it, started up again, but it hurt like *$!~ so I stopped. Now I wonder whether I could have kept going? Was the seizing psychological? Because it doesn't feel so bad now? . First time I've even started a race and dropped out. What a horrible feeling, but I guess it's all part of being a runner. . In general I think I'm putting too much mental pressure on myself over race results. Which is silly, because it's not like I'm even at elite level as an amateur. From now on I think I might start thinking of races as training runs with a bit of company. . I also think I need to race more so that each one doesn't seem like such a big deal.

And remember, other people are probably more scared of you than you are of them - imagine how you would feel if you were out at night (walking) and heard the sound of someone running towards you. The worst I've had is being egged by a goup of teenage morons from a car; I was heckled by a group of adolescents once but asked them to run to the top of the hill with me - as you can guess, they all dropped out exhuasted after a couple of hundred yards!!",2,-3

I ran because I didn't want to put a dent in my training, but ended up writing myself off for weeks afterwards. . That said, I still managed to catch up. You've still got plenty of weeks to slowly build up the long runs, especially if you're not going for a particular time. In many ways, your first marathon gives you that extra bit of freedom that you're going to get a personal best regardless! Good luck.",2,-2

TR Sounds like you're aiming to beat my Bramley time. I don't think I would recommend racing 20 miles as I did. I managed it because I was already well-conditioned (2x 20 milers in Jan and 2 x 22 in Feb before Bramley for example).,2,-1
I did a 10 mile race on Sunday - 71 mins. I am a bit concerned about the number of long runs people have done. I have been following a RW schedule for sub 3.30 and have only done 1 x 15 and 1 x 18. I do have 2 x 20 and 1 x 22 and 2 x 15 before 22/4. Hope this is OK. I am still not cofident of being able to do 8mm for LM - 7.10 for 10 miles was ok but couldnt do it for any more 13m. .

"Morning everyone. I have posted this before on another thread(sorry Rio) but thought it might be of interest to you. ""Word to the Wise"" For those who are treading the roads of London for the first time. . On race day just think legs. What! I hear you say. Think about it. You get out of bed, You have to travel to the start. You may well have had to take the train. You have to walk from the station to the start area. Now your nervous and you are walking around looking for friends or charity areas. You go to the loo, and stand in a queue. You have a coffee still standing you change and then at last you go to your start pen. What!!! sill 30 minutes to go and your still standing. Yippeee the gun goes of. Hang on you havent moved. It could take anything up to 10 minutes before you actualy cross the start line. THEN you have to run 26.2 So the moral of the story is keep off your feet as much as possible on race day. Take an old shirt,jacket,bin bag, anything to sit on wherever you can. If you dont you will wish you had. Trust me I learnt the hard way Good luck everyone ENJOY YOUR DAY.",3,-2

Caro its not that sort of a massage. If you are in pain it is just to take some of the knots out of your legs and not relaxing at all. Stiffness is all part of the marathon unfortunately - it really does hurt a lot. And it cant be avoided. Some grit and determination is needed. Roz some people carry deep heat with them to rub in when it gets tough or the muscles cramp too much. Might be worth thinking about rather than adding an extra layer.,2,-3

Having said that, my HR was definitely shooting up when I was still in the queue for a wee with 4 mins to go before the start!",1,-2

"I, like others have already said, ran with my own 500 ml bottle at the start, when empty i discarded the bottle but kept the sports valve lid. and just screwed it onto the next bottle i got. i was able to do 2 stations per bottle, but still found there was nothing at 11 thru 15 then only intermittent supply to the end. Im not sure whose fault it is. i suspect it's 6 of one and half a dozen of the other. FLM should have put more on, but likewise faster runners perhaps should have bene limited in the amount they can take. i dunno.. i aint pointing fingers. . Guess in a sense it adds to the ""challenge"" of it all. :-).",2,-3
"I did a silly thing with my 305 and set mine to marathon distance (I only bought it 2 days beforehand!) and is shut off at 26.2 miles, with 4 minutes to go. Up till then it was running about a half-mile extra. . It says Garmin can be up to 99%+ accurate but given the several tunnels we had to go through, Canary Wharf and isle of Dogs, etc, not surprised people are out by so much. I'd rather it was telling me I was slower than actual, than faster than actual. Looking forward to using the training programmes from this site with it, once I've recovered.",2,-3

"&lt;Pushes the door open one last time...>. Hi Minni - I ran 3:14 at Lochaber, which was a PB by 11mins. I use my HRM on every run, although the battery packed up during the marathon itself (typical!). Windsurfin' Susie over on the Hard Training thread has far more technical HRM training knowledge that I do, so it might be worth sticking your head in there. For me, I religiously kept the vast majority of my runs to 70% of my working heart rate / 75% HRMax. I now know what the different efforts feel like and don't need to check my watch very often. HRM training has certainly improved my sense of pacing. Almost always I run by effort and by time on feet, not pace. So for example, my tempo runs include, say, 30mins at 1/2M effort rather than a 1/2M speed. And a typical long run will be something like 2hr30min at 70% WHR, rather than an exact mileage. This approach allowed me to ramp up my mileage to 70-80mpw at peak without injury/overtraining. I ran every day for over 6 months from last September until the taper without problems (having spent the preceeding 18 weeks off injured and not running at all). In the last 4-6 weeks of training I made the switch over to quicker running, trying to hit specific paces, increasing the speed on long runs etc.. Which brought me nicely to a peak. I reckon the best thing about an HRM though is on recovery days, where it gives you permission to run slow (as slow as 10m/m, sometimes even slower). I'm a complete convert to 'active recovery' now, rather than taking rest days. It's all useful mileage! My average pace during the whole training period was only 8.48m/m. Very little speed work at all. But despite this, my eventual marathon pace averaged 7.26m/m with a slight -ve split. And my 1/2M and 10K times came also improved. HRM training takes patience though.. initially most people have to slow right down and that can be hard psychologically. So it's not everyone's idea of fun. But if you're going to give it a go, I reckon spring/summer's the perfect time to do it! A good intro book is 'Heart Rate Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot' by John L Parker. &lt;closes door on way out>",3,-3

"A comment was made about not having a GB charity place the first time you do the marathon. I disagree as people really see it a challenge the first time you do it and appreciate that it is really something hard that you have never done before. Because of this I found people quite willing to sponsor me. I'm not sure that I would get the same response if I did it again as they would know that I had completed it once. I had a fundraising target of �1500. I managed to raise �2,200. I did start fundraising in December with a Christmas raffle and did a few other activities as well as asking for sponsorship. The company where I work also gave me some sponsorship. It can be done, you just have to be willing to ask a lot of people!",2,-2

On the MP training, some of the medium-long run might be at MP and some of the ends of the long runs. I've never done much MP training, because I find your options are: Do 5-6M at MP in a longer run (which is basically what I suggested above).Do 10-12M at MP. I find this really hard and can barely manage it without entering a HM race. I usually do this a few weeks before the marathon e.g 5M easy warm-up, straight into the HM at MP. I don't want to start a fight, but I'm not a fan of running at MP in training!",1,-3

"Some great long runs going on. I wish our County XC was on the Saturday so I could have bagged one but never mind. Had a reasonably good race, came in 8th, but given the opposition I couldn't have come any higher up, and would have been very disappointed to come any lower down. There was about a 30s gap in front and behind me, which enabled me to enjoy the last lap a bit more. It was probably the hardest course I've ever run on - I reckon I wasn't faster than 10min/mile up one particular hill, and it wasn't that short, and we had to do it three times! Three main hills on each lap, and very muddy for about 50% of the lap. Think we just lost out to Coro's team for the win, but didn't hang around to find out. Anyway, a good workout, and I've been offered a place in the team for the Intercounties, so a good afternoon out all in all. Coro and EdB probably had more interesting races, so I'll let them recount their tales. Ed in particular had a pretty 'eventful' run!

I was skidding and skating all over and had to head for the grass verge to stay upright on a few occasions, so forgot the time and concentrated on making it in one piece.

"Evening everyone. . Did Llanelli today...MadWelsh it was nice to meet you too. Sorry we didn't get much time to chat but I guess after a hard race isn't the best time anyway. I was feeling really nauseous at that point. :-( That's the second time I've felt sick after a HM. Has anyone else experienced that?

In terms of training, plan is to introduce some short and fairly gentle speedwork next week, so that my 3 runs of 5/6 miles each week are something approaching quality work and to do longer, lower HR sessions in the gym. Then I'll test the waters with either a 10K or a leg of the Midlands Road Relays the first weekend in April and take it from there.

"Hi,. This is my first post so go easy. I've been training for the FLM ( my first marathon ) since December and looking for a sub 3:30 as I have stuck to my weekly Garmin training for that time. This week is supposed to be my hardest week ( 56 miles ), with a 22 miler run this weekend. However, I have picked up a couple of minor injuries and dont know what to do. . First injury :- I have recently been getting knee pains, which I think is runners knee. I have tried to keep my training up, only missing a few short runs so far. I have also started running with a knee starp which helps until I finish when I get a bit of pain. Second injury :- I'm not sure what this injury is but dont think it relates to my training, I've had it before some time ago. It's a pain in the arch of my foot when I'm walking, it's not bad at the moment but I'm guessing that it might get worse an end up as a sharp pain in the arch. The irritating thing about this is that I brought it on today when I went shopping with some new trainers on ( not running trainers ). I have spoke to other people about this ( non runners too ) and they also say they have had it from new shoes\trainers. I was hoping that while I taper my running over the next few weeks my injuries would get better but dont want to stop training yet if I can help it. Any suggestions? Thanks",2,-3

You're welcome to come to my hotel for shower afterwards if you like, have you tried booking in there? They may still have rooms available and have let us keep the rooms on for the last 5 years, so it's a good bet they will this year too, porridge in the morning too! . I've wound down so much, I think I've gone into 'sleep' mode. As you were all doing 10 milers at marathon pace yesterday, I was doing 5K in the road relays, so quite a difference! Went out for 3 miles at MP this morning before work and tomorrow night is another track session (6 x 400m @ 6 min pace), 6 on Wednesday morning @ MP and 10 x 200m strides on Thursday, then 2 days rest. Think I've been a little too laid back during the taper period!!! :-\ . Nick, my race plan is to start off at 8.15-8.20 pace and then pick it up at 14-15 if feeling good by then (and weather permitting). At least we found a good bush for going to the toilet at the Green Start, no way I'm queueing for toilets, there just aren't enough and when you gotta go, you gotta go. Puffy, hope the shins are feeling better and not as tender. Beders, that damn hamstring! I blame those Creme Eggs myself! I'm sure you can keep it under control with some icing and careful training this week, enough to get you round FLM before it gets properly sorted anyway.

We will be at the hotel from around 5pm when we get back from the Expo on Friday, what time do you get there? Euph, temp. certainly plumetted yesterday & you'll be glad that you didn't run the Northern Relays. The men ran legs 7-12 in a blizzard and could hardly see where they were going! Luckily most of the ladies teams had finished by the time the snow really came down in golf-ball sized flakes. I ran the 4th leg over 5K in a time of 20.58 on a bumpy course, so quite pleased with that in my 'warm-down' week. Our team was 13th from 33 in 1.57, so qualified for the National Road Relays.

After all that, the 10k results were up and on top of being 2 seconds slower than my last race on my watch, they have got me down as 20 seconds slower than my watch time. On the positive-Macc half next week, followed by Congleton the week after.",2,-3
"Multiple x-posts for me (must be really slow). Brian - Nice track session. Have to say not looking forward to the 20 on a weekday. ( I probably won't be able to start until 7:00pm as well :( ). MtR - Sorry to hear the not so good track session. RM - Bugger, good luck with the new mission",2,-3
It's tricky isn't it?,1,-2
"TT - My best opportunity to have run a mara would have been 2005 (I know it's not ""when I were a lad"", but it's still long enough ago for me to get misty eyed about it). I'd had 3 months at 90+mpw, an HM of 79:05, but no long runs over 18m so I reckon I would have breezed it to 20m, thereafter I'm not sure. Now I've got several dodgy bits that just can't cope with the pounding - to the extent that yesterdays 15m has given reason for concern. My September stats are. Miles 238. Ave pace 7:14. Max week: 57 miles. Min week: 52 miles. Rest days: 0. Races: 1. Wins: 1 - well sort of, if you exclude the 21 under 60's in front of me.",2,-2

"Sorry Blisters, the head won! Our road was an ice rink but once you got onto the more main roads it was fine, so I might have to put this down as a missed opportunity. Suffice to say that 20 minutes on a bike this morning and various parts of me feel as though they're about to fall off with the cold.",2,-3
"On the subject of projecting mara times off half-m's - I do know of a couple of ladies who have broken 3:15 (only just) off a half time of 1:31/1:32. I don't know of any blokes that have done it however which rather re-inforces my theory that girlies are slightly better suited to long distance running. The simple fact is that the quicker you can run your half-m's, 10 mile races etc then the more comfortable sub 7:25 pace will feel on marathon day. I tend to do 8 or 9 20+ mile runs in the build up, the 5 longest usually add up to about 110 miles. I have found the midweek 'mid' long runs of 11-15 miles have also improved my performances in the last couple of years. In line with Ex-pat's thinking, I try not to do 20 mile runs on consecutive weekends if at all possible. Lorenzo. my 3:18 in 2000 was the last time I failed to break 3:15. Being only 3 mins adrift should give you confidence aplenty to have a good go at it next time. . 11.5m run home last night. About 9m with the club tonight.",2,-1
"Intervals - done! Actually really quite enjoyed them. How bizarre. The poxy HRM is bonkers though, I think it worked at the start, then gave it up. Maybe because its scared of the readings? Anyway, the vital statistics, for those who so like them go a little something like this:. Distance: 4.36m. Time: 42:16. Pace: 9.40mi. Average HR: 122bpm :-) . Our easy bits came in at about 11mi, our intervals 8.35mi, except for the last one, which was up hill and so was 9.3mi. Not bad! Now I need a serious dunk in a hot bath. Will try not to fall asleep and drown.",3,-2
"Does anyone know if there's somewhere to find out what time you predicted for yourself? I can't remember at all whether I said 3.30 or 3.45.. or do I just need to wait and see which pen they've allocated me to? (I never thought for a moment that I'd actually get in through the ballot, but now I've got a place I've committed publicly to trying to get 3.30!!)",2,-1
"I am following the 3:45 schedule too OM but not so rigorously, I am doing LSR, the two longer midweek runs, plus one run with our group, usually a Thursday, which is usually 4 or 5 intervals of around a mile and a half but there is dedicated speed session and a hill session too in rotation but I find I have to hold back a little or I get overtired. And I ususally miss the Saturday run. So it could be argued that I'm not really following it at all really! Just back from 7 miles in an easy hour, and off for a shin-saving cold shower before a meal and DVD with Mrs Puffy.",2,-3
"BR, you are a 34.0X machine mate NICE . Jock, great run mate. Race report today. 8th place Oxford mail league Cross Country. Learned this year that I am not that slow so have started going off a lot harder, settled in around 15th place(always a few flamers on the 1st lap) Moved up a few places and started the 2nd lap just around the top10 and racing 2 chaps. Working well we all took another place and then I got ahead of the 3. Worked the climb and headed out onto lap 3 with a small gap in 8th place. Pushed hard into the wind to try to force a gap(gave myself a stitch). It worked well and I recovered in the trees and headed for home. All in all a good run and the best bit, MY KNEES FEEL FINE !!!! Worst part about todays XC was all the ribbing about the picture and article in Runners World. Even people who don't always talk that much ribbed us both.",3,-3
Sarah what a great run today....you must be pleased to get that out of the way with a lot of us doing our LSR's tommorrow. Great time as well . I aiming to be at 18 at 2hrs 50 on the day so you are storming it !! Keep it up. Hardly any snow in Hull this week so managed 3 shorter road runs and now getting focused for a 16 miler tommorrow morning......but its freezing cold outside already and forecast for minus 2 first thing. Cant say i am looking forward to the first 2 or 3 miles. Skins on the radiator tonight ! Emily can you send any NEC routes to me......i am there at a show at the end of feb and need an excuse to escape the bar and to down a third or fourth sparkling mineral water..god it can be boring sometimes being a runner. Had some second thoughts about the 'sub 4.20' on the back of my top....as i am worried i might not achieve this on the day....but have decided to go for it anyway as i am confident Jagman will locate me and carry me to the end if my pace is too slow !! Off for a big bowl of noodles...hopefully catch up tommorrow.,3,-3
"Ode: . Good to catch up yesterday. I managed a few more afterwards and ended up with 15 at just under 7:15 pace for the lot. Was tooooo cold towars the end though when the proper snow was starting to fall. Legs like blocks of ice when I'd done. Won't be there this Wednesday btw, but time and venue is the same, you'll get a warm up getting there which is good as last time they went pretty much straigh tin to 5 x5 minutes on the old railway line. Off to do an interval session with my club shortly. Pug: You coming out to the half on Sunday regardless or only if you get a number?",2,-3
" Icclesuez - hello! :) Just cross posted across you, sorry. Well done on the race. Which one did you do and how did it go?",2,-2
"In a NtS style, I spent the flight back from Lisbon doing some HR/pace analysis. Using the Fetch beats/mile calculation as a good basis, and eliminating runs under 8 miles to reduce the effect of the early miles and low HR (plus it strips out all the interval sessions). I then set a baseline of the first quarter of 2007 (when I was training for my 1st marathon, and bought an HRM). I came up with the following stats:. 2007. Q1 100%. Q2 94%. Q3 92%. Q4 88%. 2008. Q1 86%. Q2 87%. Q3 88%. Q4 85%. 2009. Q1 84%. which is broadly what I expected. Steady improvement until March 2008, then a dip in fitness with London, post-London and the summer, then a return to form in the autumn. Quite surprised to see that I'm apparently running faster for less effort than a year ago - but this quarter isn't done yet, and the margin is quite slight. 16% improvement in pace/HR implies something like 1:20mm pace improvement at easy pace (from 8:30 to 7:10) and from 7:20 HM pace to about 6:10 pace.",2,-1
"Nice runs Bramley boys. Just waiting to hear from Marders now I think . . . although I'm prepared to be impressed. Marmite - wow, great time. All the sweeter for having had to work so hard to hang in there with the group. Hard the first time but now that you have broken through to a new level it will get easier and easier. I wanted to run the Tumbridge Wells HM today (Kent Champs) but couldn't as it filled surprisingly quickly. Instead I ended up making a longer trip to Dover to run a HM there instead with a long w/u and c/d to make just shy of 19m. An annoyingly hilly second half with a strong head wind made for a very tough slow return. Did about 36.30 to half-way and then struggled into the wind to come home in 76.54. Clearly all the fast runners were at TW because my time happened to net me the win! First time for everything . . . but pleasing given the time in the saddle yesterday. Now where's my Pug -ometer. 78m for the week plus just shy of 5 hours swimming and cycling. Keep em coming.",3,-2
"Ok, here is the original plan for this week:. Week 7 (how did it get to Week 7 already? :() . Sun - Rest . Mon &ndash; Choose an undulating route so that hills are naturally included into the run. Aim to run for 50-60 mins with 5 x 5 mins @ threshold built in. This is best run as 5 min easy/5 min threshold repeated throughout. Try to include the hills naturally but cut the pace and maintain the effort when running up hill. Let yourself go downhill. . Tues &ndash; Rest (but I'm going to do Monday's run here and rest on Monday instead) . Wed &ndash; Pilates as normal . Thurs &ndash; Group run of 60 mins with the first 30 easy and the last 30 @ marathon pace. . Fri &ndash; Rest . Sat &ndash; 2 hours 20 mins all controlled and relaxed. Except I've got the Bourton 10k on Sunday, and I'm not sure just yet how its going to fit in. More when I've spoken to Nick....",2,-1

Even though i only live 4 miles from work (3 on the short cut) I can't usually run in as I have to take my boy to school first...but this week is half term so I may well give it a go! Not long to go now then Dave.....do you know its a boy? I'll guess at a girl and 8lb 12. Good going Caro.

"Hi All - just got back from the Expo. It was great - bit of hassle getting there - its so far the 'other side' of London for me. It started with 'the london marathon music' as you walked in - so that puts you in the right mood and slightly emotional! . The registration was painless and actually took about a minute as there was no-one in my queue. . Lots of different nutrition stands giving out samples - bit late to change your race nutrition now - but there were some interesting stuff like Gel Cubes which look like jelly cubes and sort of melt in the mouth and each cube held the same carb value as one Gel. They come in packs of 5 and are really compact - god I sound like I work for them. lol. Look out for them.... Lots of charity stalls, and clothing stuff. And if you go to the Pasta Party then you do hear some interesting stuff.....although I think the price is a little steep.....and you can hear the same thing if you just stand and watch outside the area. My sister wrote a HUGE good luck wish for me on the Adidas wall which was really sweet. Oh it was all fun.....and has made it feel even more exciting and scarily close. yikes. . Lots of freebies - bottle of cranberry sauce in the goody bag which is a little odd. . Free beer stand as well - but no use for me in my no alcohol regimen that I am strictly adhering to! .

"On the recovery side of things Pfitzinger and Douglas are very strong about not rushing back:. 'You have little to gain by rushing back into training, and your risk of injury is exceptionally high at this point, owing to the reduced resiliency of your muscles and connective tissue after the marathon. The (recovery) schedule starts with 2 days off from running, which is the bare minimum of time away from running you should allow yourself. If you still have acute soreness or tightness so severe that it will alter your form, or if you just don't feel like running, certainly feel free to take more than 2 days off. If ever there was a time to lose your marathoner's mind-set, the week after your goal race is it .. not running now will increase your chances of being inspired to resume hard training when your body allows it. Of course, some people don't consider themselves real runners unless they run pretty much every day of their lives. Plod through a few miles if you must, but be aware that you're prolonging your recovery.' (p169). P &D do go on to advocate light cross-training such as swimming or cycling and walking.",2,-3

I've even known the odd woman get a championship place when she hasn't got 3.15 but just over and this never happens for the men. In 2000 there were approx 6,000 women in total running the FLM compared to 24,000 men! The same goes for the women championship places going off with the elite rather than starting behind them.

As it stands I would be happy just to run round but I don't really want to start walking - partly because if the knee is still bad even that could put me out for months. I've only got a few hundred quid in sponsorship - probably would have got to about 3 or 400 in the end.,2,-2

I've been looking for accommodation and the concensus of opinion is that most places are full and not even putting peeps on waiting lists as they have so many peeps waiting. I've opted to stay at heathrow (family room �74 and parking) I've traveled to FLM before and I don't consider the distance from Heathrow too much of an issue. Brucey bonus is a sharp exit post race from Heathrow and up the M40!,2,-2

"Evening Chris,. I too kept my end of the bargain - you're obviously good for me. Did just under 1.5 miles (not easy to check mileage as I use an alley which doesn't show up on road maps) and it took me 13mins 37 secs (those secs are really important aren't they?) I'm a bit of a snail as you can see but then again I haven't run since mid Sept and had only been training then for one month after a 2 year break. It can only improve though eh? . the Hal Higdon schedules can be found on the url below - I Hope to be following the novice one soon but have to try to build up a bit first. . . http://www.halhigdon.com/marathon/Mar00index.htm.

And a Happy New Year to everyone as well. Celebrated the new year by going for my longest training run so far @ 16.25 miles in 2:22:54. Unfortunately the underside of one of my feet is aching. I don't think its Plantar Faciitis as nothing seems to be painful when I prod it. I'm suspect its just the pounding its taken this morning.,2,-2
"A true Northerner :-). Well I'm taking another rest day. I normally run on Saturday mornings whilst my daughter is at theatre school but I'm still tired so I'm leaving it til Monday. I am also having a major mental readjustment. There will be no more going for a time. I have done this before, over trained, crashed and burned. I probably won't get my sub 5 but I'll actually get to the start line which will be better than last year. I'll still do the speed work, I enjoy it :-), but I will be very strict with my self on the long run. No more turning the sound off. The beeping is there for a reason, to stop me overdoing it!!!!! I got very depressed during my training last year. Then I came down with Labyrinthitis and was out of the race. I think I was pushing too hard even tho I was run walking. Sorry if I have rambled on but that's what the forums here for :-). BTW The cars brilliant!!!!",3,-3

"morning all! Sounds like everyone is doing brilliantly, so I'm going to bring the mood down... Nah, not really. Although my run at the weekend was not the best it's still further than I've ever gone before. Is anyone else feeling frustrated even though they are doing things they couldn't have comprehended a year ago? Anyway was aiming for 16 miles in 3 hours, but made it back in 3 hrs 25 m, so not great. It was in a new area near Worcester and the Malverns and was pretty hilly compared to running in SW London, so that's my excuse! The only good thing is I have recovered well and have no aches and pains today! 4 hr 30 is looking like a fading dream but still as long as I make it around I will be happy. Silverstone next weekend, when of course the goal is 2 hours, but will be happy to finish feeling good. Keep up the good work everyone, not long left now!",3,-2

Nice to have long rest. i had 3 days off in a row 2 and a half weeks ago, and it really did me good. Started feeling very restless though so went and did that ridiculous Rhayader race which nearly killed me and had to have another 2 days off!

"I'm finding this taper period quite tough to handle mentally, and there's still 10 days to go! Time is dragging. Also I use running to relax and without that outlet I feel a bit wound up! No matter how many taper articles I read I can't escape the feeling that my conditioning is starting to ebb away. Stupid I know, but there you go. Although I am looking forward to the 17/4 so much it will also be a relief to get my old life back. I shall of course carry on running, but like Tallguy I'm really missing my bike. I haven't run since doing a rather painful 4m on Tuesday. My thighs seem to develop new aches each time I get up in the morning plus I have a sore groin. I know there's nothing serious but it all adds to the tension. I am planning no more than 2 more runs. Probably 8m at marathon pace on Sat and then a slow 5m next Tuesday.

My left hip pain aggravated me most of the time & I also found that after about 7M my right knee began hurting too. The knee pain was directly above the kneecap & is something completely new to me. I continued to run on with it though & the pain went eventually at about 11M. I've been icing it (& the hip) this afternoon and will continue to do so for as long as is needed. . I will definately be on the start line next week, I just hope it's not with a strategy that's had to be revised at the last minute. Happy tapering.... TTT.",2,-3

"It was my first marathon yesterday and think I entered a fair time on my form (5.10) and started in pen 9. I had been warned about congestion in the first 6 miles but there was none - all very civilised and chance to get a good rhythm going. The dodging and weaving came in the last 6 miles when I was getting a rhythm again after a bad patch through 17-20 (there were bits where you couldn't even try to run in the isle of dogs, it was just a stream of walkers). Perhaps they can put in theoretical slow and fast lanes (like at swimming pools) and walkers are obliged to move into the other lane, with some encouragement from the many course marshalls. However, I do know that at 22 miles when you're tired etc, the last thing you need is some ""police"" telling you what to do. I plodded in at 5.55, but with a smile on my face.",2,-2

Sweetest thing - just goes to show how effective a run/walk can be - only 8 mins slower than me - and I ran all the way. I din't deduct my loo stop either - although was tempted - don't see much point though - might look better to everyone else but you still know your time....,2,-2
Am 46 too but think the tiredness is definitely a hormone thing - nothing to do with my years! Mentally I'd say I was about 13...... Have a 5m run planned with a friend on Saturday morning - nice and early at 9. Should be ok by then hopefully.,2,-2

"I'm on 40 + at the moment, although my LR at the weekend was cut to a paltry 8 miles after my husband spent all day out windsurfing. Was not amused. Probably not a bad thing, though as I had two very tough sessions last week (one interval and one tempo) which left me feeling quite sore. My speed is definitely improving, though, so the work is worth it. Next sunday should see me up to 18 miles for the long run, and then I go up to 20 milers for the four weeks after that.",2,-3
"Hi R-B, Running efficiency will improve with fitness, it is normal for beginners to be heavy on their feet as, as you mention, there isn't sufficient pace in the early stages for a smooth heal/toe action. As fitness comes stride will lengthen a bit and breathing will be more in rythm with cadence so the whole action gets smoother.",2,-2

"Hi everyone, I just wanted to let MelF know that I'm all over the place with my exercise too at the moment. I do feel guilty reading how many of you have set new goals and are working towards those, and I want to recapture the determination I had to stick to a training plan before the marathon. I think maybe now that the autumn weather is coming I might find it easier to get out there, but I know ultimately that the incentive has got to come from me, and not the weather!!",2,-2
"hi all. you're dead right about the speed sessions kezzabee, I'm not keen on them at the best of times and quite often the only time i do them is with the running club, or when i run with a couple of mates (who are usually better than me). Been doing quite a bit of off road at the moment preparing for my first proper fell race on sunday. Although I don't do any structured speed sessions, you can certainly go pretty damm fast downhill after struggling on your hands and knees up the blxxdy hill in the first place ! went out for a 45 min session at lunchtime, a bit of a slog uphill on the road for a good 700-800 ft of climbing then down through the fields and tracks through the woods which was a bit of fun in my road shoes after the recent rain ! All good practice for sunday, 7 miles and 1000ft of climbing...ummmm. The guy i was running with is a proper fell runner and did it last year and he was reassuring me ' just dig in on the way up, some of it is hands on knees , and try and hang on, then see if you make up a bit on the way down, just don't go too fast or you'll be too knackered for the next steep hill...gulp. looking forward to it more and more !, although possibly not as intimidating as that bleep test moggie ! have a good day all. cheers. beders",2,-2

First 10 miles are gradually up high, second half downhill, with 3 fairly steep downhills.

Kept going but the last couple of miles were hard and had to walk at bit! But managed to keep running the last mile and even managed a pretty good sprint finish (good me for!).

"RB - that's awesome mate; well earned, and hope you take time to have a few beers and enjoy your holiday. Not too bothered about your HR stats (we'll let CM sneak off to a private place to drool over those), but very keen to hear your mental state throughout the race. eg,. What pace did you set out to run? Did your plan go out the window when you were running well? At what point did you start thinking about your likely finishing time? Were you consciously (or subconsciously) racing CRAB? Did you think about the feedback you'd have to supply to this forum? (did it help or hinder progress) - can't deny I've thought about having to cough up my result on here mid-race over the past few months. What was the priority during the last 10k? Just get to the finish, or still aim for a particular time? Was running 2.46 harder or easier than running 3.00 - for me, the quicker the race, the easier it has been, if you know what I mean. Did you mentally rehearse your reaction to crossing the line, somewhere around the half way mark? Did you cry? Fkg hope not. What's next on the RB agenda? Only a couple of minutes from qualifying for those luxury bogs at London next year. Questions, questions.....look forward to your answers.

"Just back from picking up my number from the expo. Sorry Sammy couldn't wait til Saturday, so I'll be putting my feet up while you're standing in the queue. Really enjoyed it. Got my feet analysed & confirmed that I am a neutral runner which is just as well as I wasn't going to change me trainers at this late stage. Paul Tergat was there but I see he's dropped out. What with him and Paula, if another 30,000 drop out I might be in with a chance.",3,-2
Tempting Andy - I wonder if I can persuade the other half (have two daughters as well who want to be there). What hotel is it? The main reason we're not staying over is that we're used to driving to London and it's only a 90 minute drive (to Stratford or one of the DLR stations) and about another 30 minutes by tube. . It's just that all my marathon nerves are being channelled into this one thing right now.,2,-2

I'd start raising money for a charity now.The best chance you will have of getting a place is through the golden bond.If you can raise in the region of �1000 by November you'll have a good chance of getting one.The hardest part of the FLM is getting a place. As for the training everything you have said seems right.,2,-2

"Evening all. Was planning on a run or two this weekend, or a bit of cycling, but instead opted for a night out clubbing on Friday (we were in the pub by 4.30pm and home about 2ish!) and then spent the rest of the time paying back my other half for her support since January and spending time with the little one doing some nice 'family things'. Do feel totally refreshed however and literally chomping at the bit now, so going to head out tomorrow after work for a 4 miler. SBF - That analysis of results was fantastic, and ashamed to say that somehow the reds did beat the blues :o(. i uess we all need to keep the momentum going to achieve the goal of sub 4. Last night just before bed I was watching a little bit more of the live FLM coverage I sky+ 'ed last sunday. Is that your first appearance on TV Cas?? ;O) That Bob the Builder costume must have taken a lot of efort to make, it really was quite impressive. Afraid I'm not going to make Abingdon, just not practical for me to get there and already have plans for October i'm afraid. But I will still hang around here for support/banter with my own races if thats ok? And maybe next year the FLM might be in the picture and we will defo have to meet up? My race plan for the summer looks like this:. 10 mile race May. 10k race June. 10k race July. Half Marathon August. Not sure about Sept yet. Half Marathon October. With the training required I hope to retain/improve overall fitness and improve speed. And lose a bit more weight!",3,-2
"A solid performance, good pacing throughout. Must be harder to run sub 3 in a 17C Vienna compared to a 12C London. Doesn't research on marathon times, find 12C the ideal temp, and 1C above or below that = loss of performance of 1% (not sure how they would measure this). What's needed: A cool Autumn marathon.",2,-2
"DN. For interest, I never did get an email back from the Cardiff Race Director on the potential safety issues surrounding the 2:30 to 3:00 finishing time. Just think of the aggro that the poor winner will suffer? Can I hang on to your skirt tails in Abingdon?",1,-2
"hi guys. not been on here for ages, i am struggling to get properly nack into running again. Lovced the marathon and def want to do another one, have entered nottingham half in September so I need to get my backside in gear! Got ill at begiining of May so was out fr a fortnight but I am enjoying do some excercise other than running, back into my circuit training again. BTW I raided �2500 for charity! Well done on the amount you did BP!!! I entered the Edinburgh marathon but I have postponed place to next year as wasn't able to get the training runs in a the weekends due to being away all the time. Glad to see some of you still about.",3,-3
"Hi all,. Been going out a lot with my club recently and really enjoying it. I am definately improving now because of it, last Friday we did 2.5 mile relays which was hard but good. I got out with them on Mondays and Wednesdays. Tomorrow we do the Haytor Heller course which actually takes place on Sunday, I am going to be a marshall. Did a good 7 mile run last night, a lot of hills. Doing a 6 mile race on Friday evening which I am looking forward to, I am really enjoying my running at the moment. I am hoping to build up to Dartmoor Vale Marathon in October and then hopefully London again next year.",3,-1
"In reverse. If I maintained stride length, and ran 170 spams, my marathon time would be 3:40.",2,-1
"Mike - my target marathon pace his year was 7:00, (in 2005 it was 7:15 and the Wednesday runs were correspondingly slower) so that's what I was working up to. Sometimes you get carried away and go a little faster. At the start of the build-up they were a little slower, but as your fitness improves they get to 7:00 so in my eyes they were marathon-paced. Threshold running would be 6:40 pace for me. And anywya, if I could manage a 20-mile race at 6:45 pace, surely 7:00 pace is OK for those runs?",2,-2
"Hello runners,. well missed a load of posts since the 2006 FLM due to ligamant damage.... But am back!! deffered my 2006 place so will be in the 2007. Firstly is this the right place? sub 4.00 hrs? Or am I too early?? Help!",3,-2
"Roobarb also I think everyone recovers differently, after Lochaber I raced a 3k and got a PB only 4 days afterwards and after Dumfries I raced and got a PB for a 10k only a week afterwards.

Is it a full length one?,1,-1
Well its certainly picked up on this thread. Welcombe everyone. Jellybabe and viffer are well ahead of us on the training front but there's still plenty of time to go. O'Donut which training plan are you going with. Stylish like you I have found a couple of races that I have just entered to try the mileage build up. Both are hilly off road runs (bit new to me) but sound fun?? Drogo 10 and Bicton Blister both in November in Devon. Cheques should be cashed at the end of this month if you are in. Speak soon :o),2,-1

"Susie Sorry - fingers still a bit numb several hours later. . Lord D Thanks for that, but I have been doing the step-drops 30 times every morning before I do anything else and in the evening when I remember. Think I'll work up to 50 reps though. I've been told I have tendonosis (i.e. degeneration) rather than tendonitis (inflammation). Probably my achilles had mis-spent youths! . Don't worry about remedial IT for your daughter - it probably means she has excellent social and other non-cognitive skills instead! Lots of evidence (from day-job) that non-cognitive skills (e.g. communication, team-working, self-efficacy) are increasingly important in the labour market.",3,-2

I also started using Fetch in 2007. Good fun and even takes the football and badminton in as X training. No Garmin or anything more than a watch here so it is my only source of information. . I haven't sorted my FLM place yet JBSS but am still hopeful. It may have to be charity in the end though. I will let you know what success I have.

I didn't buy any official merchandise last time I ran London marathon 2002.

"CG - Its a shame to hear you say ""this thread is a little bit scary"". If you are aspiring to sub 3:15 then surely this is your thread? There are a good few on here that are now running sub-3 style mileage and times, probably as a result of training going better than expected, and I hope no-one else has been put off by this or is worrying too much that their mileage/speed isn't up to it? I know I've ran 3:06 before off about 40mpw and 7.8min/mile LSRs, so I figure so can anyone else. Anyway after all that rambling I don't have anything more to say wrt your question that hasn't been said above. E.g., I let my legs chose my sunday LSR pace and it ended up being a lot faster than most training plans would suggest - am yet to find out whether or not that was a stupid thing to do.. Was it really worth the risk? Doubt it.",2,-2
"Finally gotten rid off my cold after 10 days, bloody thing. Depending on whats on telly later and how awake i feel (went from evening shifts to morning shifts with work today so i get less sleep for a night) will see how far i run tonight. Currently tipping down so i think it'll be a treadmill session. Aim for 6 miles roughly i think. Gotta remember to ask what each trendline on my funky spreadsheet graph is as i havn't a clue, mainly as its a spreadsheet i aquired off another runner at work. Heck even the boss has been out a few times over the last few weeks at lunchtime.",2,-3

"PG - here is the link to the part of this site with the rcae time calculator on it. basically it is a formula used to convert one races time to anothers which is pretty accurate and is also in the middle of the range you would get if you used some of the other ways of working out race times from other races. Debra - well done on the 15 miles. i managed to get 6 miles done in 56 mins running aorund stafford on tuesday night as i was down there for a conference with work. Stopping up in the bar until 1am and a slight twinge in my ankle meant i ditched the planned 6 or 9 mile run pre breakfast. Did 6 mile on the treadmill before work at lunchtime and the ankle wasn't to bad just a minor ache at the moment so i think i've tweaked it probably on the rough ground alongside the dual carriage way in stafford. Still looking to do 20 miles or so on sunday and as of yet i havn't decided where i'll run too, probably stock up on drinks and some food and just run where ever the heck i feel like it. I'll probably check i can measure off my garmins sporttracks stuff indivdual sections so i can combine in a load of differing sized laps in the area.",2,-2

Great tips above,. also dont forget the sun cream lotiion, the abount of times I have been wind and sun burnt at maras......

"Morning All. just spent the last 10 mins catching up with everyones posts/reports. Congrats and well done to everyone! In reality it was that hot that it was an achievement just to finish! Well that has to be the toughest thing I have ever done. I expected the last 6 miles to be tough but that was something else! Finished in 3.18.58. Am absolutely chuffed to bit and still haven't stoped smiling! Think I slept about 2 hours last night, i'm still buzzing! Annoyingly I think I made the last few miles so hard myself by going off too fast! At 14 miles I was had averaged 7.17 min miles, including 5 around 7 mins. By 18 I had dropped the pace slighty to about 7.30 mins miles and was still well on for sub 3.15 (about 3.13 ish) If I could have kept that pace up. But from 20 onwards it seemed like someone had tied bricks round my ankles and I dropped to 7.50's and by 24 8.10's. managed to run a sub 8 in the last mile but the heat and my quick start had finished me. Think if it hadn't been for the crowd I would have pulled over and collapsed in the gutter, but had a lot of friends placed over the last few miles that really kept me going! Anyway am really pleased and honestly think I have got sub 3.15 in me. Just have to learn from my mistakes and hope its cooler next time!",4,-2

Hippo - don't you think it's about time you gave that body of yours a rest. When's your next race planned. I know you have to have a run every day, but you need some time to recover. You'll end up burning yourself out. Can't keep up that pace forever you know. Now behave yourself and have another drink. Hic Not too heavy on the tonic though, you know what it does to you.",2,-2

"Corredor - great PB, but just a word of warning - advice from one of my club coaches: better to improve on your PB by 5 seconds each race than take a huge chunk off and then have to beat that next time. On a more positive note (unless you've been running for years...), I also read that whatever age you start running/racing, you will improve on your times for c.10 years before you plateau, so go for it.",3,-2

Padams - I've just been sent the results from last night. The overall standings (after 3 races) make interesting reading. Pos OVERALL Score Points. 1 Garden City Runners 850 36. 2 St Albans Striders 1517 28. 3 Barnet & District 1593 26. 4 Royston Runners 2187 15. 5 NHRR 2119 14. 6 Bishops Stortford 3060 7. You will need to put a good team out for your home event next week if you don't want Barnet to take second place from you (they came within 60 points of beating us last night). It's also going to be close to see who out of Royston and NHRR will be relegated. The person who won is down in the results as having a double-barrelled surname. Good luck to those of you having a punt this afternoon.,2,-2

"Well done Katie, Vrap and GF on your awesome efforts. Vrap - I think you are being too modest. A PB after that sort of exertion is phenomenal. Fast times too for Lorenzo and TT. MTR - You will soon be back on form and will fly in your DS trainers. Are you planning to alternate them with a different shoe? . RFJ and Smiffie - Thoughts are with and don't rush back. It's not fun. I seem to be in an increasing amount of pain and am ccoming to the conclusion that I might have to stop running again. I was given the number of a good physio but luck would have it that she is off on holiday for 3 weeks. I had quite a long telephone conversation wit her and she thinks I now have a secondary injury (possibly PF) caused by adjusting to compensate for original injury. I will carry on running as long as the pain gets no worse but I'm not looking forward to my HM tomorrow.Finishing that will be harder than any race I have ever done. No PBs for me in the near future!",4,-2
"Hey Pug . Sorry to hear about the injury. Best advice from me is put all your renowned focus oin to getting it right - do whatever the fizz / sports therapist says - treat the ice / stretch / mobility exercises or whatever as if they are key parts of your training program. Then, see how it goes, maybe you could refocus on Luton (1st weekend in December) as TippTop suggests, or come down to La Rochelle the weekend before with me. Even if you don't get a Champs start for London, you will still have a pen 1 Green start, and I'm sure you wouldn't let a couple of Eastenders actresses get in your way! Blisters . Judging by the state of Worcester City centre today, you're not wrong about what'll be with you Sunday and Monday. - Never seen the River so high, and its going to take a while to receed because no matter where you go there are great expanses of water linked to the smallest of streams as the underlying water table has risen so much. Managed to find a 7 mile dryish route this evening - would have been a slightly more achilles friendly 6, but I got stuck on the tow path for a while with canal on one side and flooded road on the other - thankfully it had stopped raining by that point, otherwise I might have been a tad worried!",2,-2

"Welcome back TR . Good running DanA . Good racing JEJ . Will have to give video clip a miss due to dial-up connection at home and very effective security at work. Which leaves me with today's 10k attempt. The fred consensus earlier in the week was that my endurance is good, my speed is not. Oh boy, that was the case today. I could list some excuses (missed a week after Dorney, only one speed session since, and that was on Tuesday, high mileage for me since, etc.) but the truth is is was just a bad day at the office. A very bad day at the office. Legs felt a bit heavy in my warm-up but the first K was done in 3.48 and I thought things would be alright. But from then on in my legs got heavier and heavier. It's a fast-ish course, but not pancake flat. I finished in a miserable 40.53. Not a PW (principally because my first ever race was a 10k and I've tended to do 10Ks at the start of training blocks, untapered) but not what I wanted. Will probably write it off as 6 miles @ HMP as frankly that's all it was. Ho hum. Will console myself with a recovery run this evening so that at least the mileage total for the week doesn't get wreaked to boot.",3,-3

"Well done Tracey & Roobs on your long runs. Lyndy - I get up most mornings at 4.30 to 4.45 to go training, but for my long runs I do go out a bit later as I like to have my brekkie first.

I hate running at night, have to go out tonight for a short run before going to the gym as I'm a bit behind on this week's mileage, it's 28 degrees down here in Devon today",2,-2
"Evening all. Loads of posts to catch up with. TR - one of my favourite subjects that - the grandparent rule in football. Always made me laugh that at the same time as Ireland were getting grief over using it, England had Butcher (born in Singapore), Barnes (born in Jamaica) and Dorigo (born in Australia) playing for them.... I always maintained that the rule made sense though as emigration was becoming much more common. The rugby one is a joke though, live somewhere for 2 years and you can play for them. We played Italy last year, and they substituted a Springbok for an Argie. I thought we were playing an AllStar XV. Sorry to hear the knee is playing up btw. Fingers crossed it'll clear up in time for NF. JEJ - I don't see any reason why you can't be down at that level yourself in time. Might take a bit more mileage though. That's obscene to be able to do that pace off so little mileage. Fair play to him. I've got a rest day tomorrow, tf. Made it through yet another mad week of training with just a slightly tight left quad to show for it. I think that's a decent return ;-) Total for the week was 120 (off 6 days, with some good quality in there). Counting back 7 days I've done 128.25 so Dull, I'm afraid your PB is mine! ;-) ) Couldn't do it on a regular basis though. Only 1 more week of this to go, and I have to say I'm glad. I think it's the mental side I find harder than the physical side. Still, what doesn't kill you......",3,-2

"mornin all. had a really good club run last night, a hilly 7 miles. For the last few weeks i've got back to the club feeling like a complete wreck, as i've linked in with a group of runners who are a bit faster than me, and several times around the course i've been puffing and panting so hard and thinking.......i can't do this........i can't do this, but just about hanging on in there. Anyway last night, i got back feeling ok.....in fact as high as a kite as i kept up, with only feeling the 'omegod i can't do this' once, and that was up a long hill, but did it . Strange how your body (or my body anyway) seems to struggle along at the same pace for so long, then suddenly feels better one night for no apparent reason. Just hope it stays. Probably the tough speed session last week helped? Will rest achilees now 'till club run (about 5-6 miles) on Friday, then try and get round 13.5-14 mile course on Sunday, in last Sundays time of around 1.53 ish.

Our house resembled Emergency Ward 10 this weekend with both Small Children badly; one recovering from an op and beginning to milk it somewhat (he is male) The other (female) quietly ill on the sofa with some kid-like lurgy. Managed to run never the less. 6.5ish easy miles on Saturday (no gadgets at all so no pressure, which I prefer for this type of run) 12 miles this afternoon, kept up a decent pace in view of the fact I wasn't going mega long and averaged 8.25mm on an undulating route. Did what I always do and started slow (9mm, 8.40-8.45s) then picked up the pace as the run went on to 8-8.15mm. The last 3 miles of this route are pretty much all climb so it's tough to pick but the pace further but useful training I feel. Good running all.",3,-2
What's more (I'm sorry if I sound a bit full of myself) but whilst checking the Edinburgh Marathon website I noticed the age qulification based on half-marathons is 1:35:00 which is only 2 min 30 secs faster than my PB. Does anyone know of a flat Half near London in the next two months!,2,-2
"Dan A - only a couple of miles from me. It would be nice to recoup the cost of my new apartment in prize money, but I guess I'd have to win the FLM for that. Any good team prizes - I can think of 3 other local 29 - 32min guys...?",2,-1

She ran with me and we did speed reps. She ended up with double pneumonia! So be warned. Rest and lots of warm fluids is best. When they say feed a cold I think they mean just to ensure you have plenty of vitamins and minerals etc (from the days when people had really bad diets) So lots of vitamin C and do as much (or little) as you feel up to.",2,-2

"Wardi I failed to run sub 1.30 at Milton KeynesHM 06 and shortly after ran a 3.01 PB at Abingdon 06. I wouldn't get too down about a performance in just one race. I remember talking to you post FLM07. My advice (for what it's worth) is just keep working. I have run 4 PB's in 2007, having started road racing aged 46. Sadly none over the marathon distance, but I'm convinced by the way I feel that I'm still getting faster and stronger the more I train. I am lucky enough to sometimes chat to rivals. One of them told me they started aged 38 and reckoned they peaked at 52. The guy is now 58 and considerably faster than me. Keep on trucking. It's a long road, but hopefully we will both get our over 50 sub 3. Best Wishes. Dull .",3,-2
"The OCD got the better of the CNBA, so I went out for the lunchtime reps session4 x (5 min hard + 30 sec off + 1 min hard + 90 sec off)The last long rep was stopped halfway as the lead guy went over on his ankle - he was ok, so after a couple of minutes we finished with a fast 3 min. A tough session, esp when running into the wind. . Like Joolska, I don't mind occasionally running for charity, but I don't like assumption that the two go hand in hand by default. When MrsC and I got married in '06 we took the view that as we had being living together for the previous 11 yrs, already had 2 kids, mortgage etc we didn't want wedding presents so we asked people to sponsor us. Our friends/family were very generous at the time, so I wouldn't want to ask people again.",2,-2
"Good running Martin! Doesn't matter if runs are a little shorter than the schedule, wouldn't worry too much. Back from my intervals, really enjoyed them yet again - yay! Did 7 x 800m fast with 2 min recoveries. still don't do them spectacularly fast, think the fastest averaged 7.30mm pace and the slowest was around 10!! (v. steep hill though). Quick question re: hill-running. Do you guys run hills on your toes??? Feels like such an amateur question to ask, but have only just noticed what a different it makes, it's incredible!! HOWEVER, right big toenail is black again and very weak, so not sure they like it so much.",3,-2
"Afternoon all. Another outbreak of sensibility this end. Had a carp night, kept waking up cos of the lurgy, so decided to forego the planned lsr and slept instead. No running til Monday at the earliest this end now. Still, at least I got 50+ in the bag. Just a shame I missed out on the other planned 40...... Sorry to see there's other lurgified folks, but better now than 2-3 months time! Don't know what's going on with everybody being sensible. Must be something in the water! At this rate I reckon next week will be primarily slow mileage again, which will leave me with a 9 week build up and a 2 week taper. Should be more than enough to get my tergat I think. gatorade - league? KM - I wear adidas supernova cushion too. Have you found a replacement for them cos the new models are wider across the midfoot, or does that not affect you? Good luck to all weekend racers.",2,-3

"Blisters top running, great effort. . The forum shows theres been some good training this weekend. I managed my first ever 18 mile run on Sunday, tried to make it slow as recommended, but ran it in 2hr 17 mins (maybe a bit too fast for 1st time on longest ever run). At the end felt tired and realising just how far 26 miles really is. . Today I went for what was supposed to be a short slow run with a friend who is also running FLM. Unfortunately friend is very fast experienced runner (around 3hr for Marathon) and I wanted to try and keep up. We did 9.3 mile Cross Country in 1hr 8min felt like nearly Tempo pace due to wet boggy ground. I am going to take it slower for rest of week, but feel good (no aches or pains).",3,-2
"I haven't touched alcohol since the day I bought my first car 23 years ago, so it's not an issue for me. Kenyan hills tonight - 3 x 10 minutes with 2 minutes recovery between the sessions. Averaged around 6:40 pace with the heartbeat average and max slowly climbing until the last few laps had a peak of 167 and an average of 166! SaFe to say I couldn't have gone much harder. Quite a satisfying session though, if only my shins weren't so sore afterwards. Time for a soak in the bath I think.",2,-2

"Lardarse- Haile only got to half way last year. Be careful copying him! Gels and jelly babies seem identical in content, and I've used both. For the race last year, I carried a couple of gels but didn't actually use them. The Lucozade sport seemed to work fine for me. For training runs, I don't bother with gels or any food. The idea on long slow runs is to train your body to burn fat and slowly deplete the available muscle glycogen, so I feel it counterproductive to fuel during the run. As for one jelly baby per mile- whatever works for you really. Be aware that you will burn 100-150 calories each mile, so any food intake for fuel replacement will make a relatively small impact (unless you can consume 100 calories per mile, in which case you will struggle to force it down!). Timing-wise, the earlier you consume the better. Nothing you eat after 18 or so miles will make any difference, as it takes a fair amount of time to metabolise the gel / food. Same principle for water- drink early before you are really thirsty, rather than playing catch-up with fluids later in the race.",2,-2

I much prefer less congestion and fewer fat joggers in headphones, too many clothes, carrying 10 gels and 2 water bottles who stupidly line up in the sub-1:30 pens getting in my way. Less hanging about at the start when the fields are smaller too. . So well done on merely suriving that horrible experience. Chin up lass!",2,-3

I would recommend waiting at least two weeks before signing up to any more marathons. I signed up to two just after FLM 2006 -spent the year training for marathons. Having said that I have also signed up for FLM '09 but mostly to keep my rejection count up. If I get a place next year it will defo. be done as a fun run with some outfit or other - no ladies cloths or underwear though as I saw quite enough of that on Sunday during the race.,2,-2

"Hi Folks,. Bit nervous about posting in here amongst proper serious runners but I am looking for a little advice and perspective, if possible? Long story short is that I began running in late summer 2005 and completed the Dublin marathon in Oct 05 in 4:23. Since then I have finished a further 6 in progressivly faster times until I hit 3:15:06 in Rotterdam at the weekend. I've also done a couple of 10k races as 'sharpeners', the most recent of which was ~600m short and I finsihed in a race time of 37:5x, so I figure it would have been ~40min mark for the full race distance. Training stayed pretty static at 30ish miles until the last marathon where I upped it to around 35 - 45 miles per week on average and brought in speed work for the first time. Having finsihed Rotterdam feeling fairly strong (last three miles were all under 7:06 min/mile pace) I have this mad idea that I couldgo a bit faster. Current plan is to focus on a 10k race at the end of June (I've never focussed on a 10k before and it'll be interesting to see how fast I can go) and then a marathon in Oct. But I have this mad idea that - with proper speedwork and more miles - I might get close to teh magic 3. Am I being delusional?",3,-2

And before that I was at my sister's 4th wedding celebrations in Colchester. But I need a new knee. I went for a run on Sunday morning, despite the ache in my knee. Got to 6.7 miles and I had to stop and walk the remaining 3 miles home as I couldn't bend my right knee any more - it was agony. Since then I have been icing it and taking Nurofen and walking backwards downstairs. The pain has reduced, but I jogged 1.5 miles while coaching last night, and it's not good enough to run on yet. Very fed up. . Off to Bristol shortly.",2,-3
"Another quality mileage week from TT - just looking at your target HM time compared to last year shows it's obviously working well for you. 19 miles for me tonight, pity only 1 of them was running but good to do a bit anyway. My 9 min mile this evening was slightly more comfortable than Fridays so at least I know I'm not making it worse with my 1 mile jogs. Average speed for the bike ride was 18.1 mph with a cadence average of 91.6 so a nice improvement on the same route as Friday. Starting to really enjoy this cycling malarky.",3,-2

"I go away for a week, and it takes hours to catch up. Actually I'm still away, but whiled away an hour while it was raining in SW France to log on via the wonders of a mini-laptop and campsite wi-fi. Loads of congrats to the sub-35 cew at Yateley (Gobi, JAP, TT & Jock), belated congrats to Jools for her win, and to Pug for racing again, plus Marders, BEJ and others, especially WTGY who was dead unlucky to miss out on a sub-37. Nice to see Crab, Pug, Brian and Njord all making an appearance as well. Training in France is going OK. It's a brilliant area for running with miles of tarmac bike paths through the forests and along the coast road. A bit hot and hilly in places, but that's good. Also being doing some decent beach running. The beach is about 100 miles long, so you can just run as long as you like and then head back. About 60 miles for the week, including 15 miles of barefoot beach running, plus lots of sea swimming, been trying to do about 600m per day, although when there's a current, it's impossible to go by distance - yesterday I swam for 10 minutes and moved 10 metres - today I swam about 1000m with less effort.",3,-2

"Cheers for the sock links/comments. My issues with them though is simply that they tend to stick in all the wrong places on me (same places with every pair I've tried). As a result I gave up wearing socks a few months back and feel better for it. The only slight niggle is the insoles on the Streaks. May try glue them back and see if that does it. Gobi - why braver? For not wearing socks full stop or for not wearing them until it gets really cold? Not a bad tip there Jools . I like that. 10m with a bit of PMP work thrown in at lunchtime. Felt a bit rubbish at first (though HR was where it should be), presumably from having a carp night's sleep (jr is a little poorly at the moment so woke up a few times), but loosened/woke up eventually. Done my usual by looking for consistent splits on feel (with an occasional glance at the watch to confirm) and felt much better as it progressed. I even felt good enough to open up a bit for part of the last mile and have a bit of fun. Warming up nicely here too. I was covered in goose bumps at the start, but it was quite nice by the time I finished....",3,-2

"How to choose? . Going on the choices for the GNR Super Six, it seems to me that the criteria is to have a range of ages/ability/experience, which is fair enough that way there should be something in the resulting traing programmes and blogs to help everyone on their way. To be honest if I were a judge I'd sort the entries into non-starters (basically those who haven't followed the rules - the main one being 250 words!) and then have an idea of the categories I was after and sort the rest into those, see if there were any stand out winners or losers, if not chuck them in a hat and draw out a winner for each catagory. While there are a few entries that pull on the heart strings, most are hard to distinguish as being any more worthwhile than another (mine being one of those). Anyway as I see it my method of choosing is probably the only way I'll win! ;-)",2,-2

"Hi, My name is Susan, nearly the dreaded 41.My brief running history is as follows......dont blink or you'll miss it! . Avoided running at school and afterwards, then I joined the fire service and learned to run with ladders and heavy pumps etc. Scroll forward 10 years and I discovered that i enjoyed running [without ladders and fire kit!] and did a 10k in about 52 minutes. Scroll forward again to getting a promotion which entailed a 90 minute commute each day which effectively killed my free running time. Now, working back near home and getting back into fitness. At the gym doing fitness classes a few times a week and running occasionally with my border collie pup. Current goals - hubby has done 6 half marathons and I need to do a full one to beat him! {not that he eveer mentions it -ha!} Plus I want to run off the stone+ I have put on with commuting, deskjob and drinking wine! I know I enjoy running once I get back into it. Marathon goal - to get round in daylight hours and raise lots of money for the firefighters charity, the Stroke Association and my local hospital who looked after my dad so well. Reasons for deserving this..... well, I am sure there will be more deserving than me and good luck to all of you but, on a serious note, my family has had a hard three years after my dad had a stroke and he has recently died. I have been involved with mum and dad making sure everything is ok with them and the pressure for those years has been tremendous, then my dad's death and everything that goes with it, add onto that a very busy role at work, running a home, family, horse and small business too. .

"Sympathies, Wotsit. Wouldn't it be nice to know what brings on those terrible, energyless runs. And also - though rare for me - those days where it's all effortless and you float along and you just feel like you can go faster and faster. If this is the end of week 4, isn't there a 5M or 10K race scheduled for you, Wotsit, this weekend? I'm doing the Watford half, which the organisers pretend is undulating. Last year I heard someone say at the bottom of yet another hill 'The last time I saw a hill this steep I had skis on'. This year we might have weather fit for skiing - forecast temp -2 to +2, chance of snow, winds 17mph. Lovely.",2,-2

"Various niggles seem to have got worse over the last couple of days, particularly an achilles problem I've had for two weeks since Watford HM, seemingly worsened by the long run in deep snow last weekend. So had a rest day yesterday and will take it easy now until Bramley. . I'm going to stick with my 6:15, 6:00, 5:45, 5:45 plan for now but may well change my mind and go for something slower depending how I feel in the first couple of miles. . Bramley. BEJ - 1:55-odd. EdB - 1:58:45. Padams - 1:58. TippTop - 1:59:59.",1,-2

"Good stuff Sue C those 2 mile reps definitely the worst of the faster running. Good running too Joe Hawk - I am also on the RW schedule but have to say struggling a bit this week - blame overdoing hills on Tuesday but 11 miles last night was hardest for weeks. And still have 8 at MP and my first 20 to do. . TR , I'm doing Christchurch but taking 10 mile option. What pace are you going to run?",3,-2
"Welcome Carlo, sorry cannot offer advice on shoes other than try another running shop and see what they recomend. Ian, forgot to say, I am running the Essex 20 as well, I will be running in a Southend Athletics vest (short woman with dark hair, spanish looking), say hello if you see me.",2,-2
"Minni, I'm the opposite. This morning I was perfectly happy out on the roads on my own, but once I got into the woods I started to get antsy (possibly because they back onto a fairly dodgy estate though). I imagine murderers, rapists and savage dogs around every corner. In fact the dogs are not imagined.",2,-3
"M Diddy - thats a great 20 miler, well done. Went and did the 5 x 1200 session that Astride challenged me to, and despite feeling a bit peaky today and yesterday, it went well. After a 2.3m w/u @ 7:13, the reps went 4:33, 4:28, 4:26, 4:25 & 4:26, then 2.3 home @ 7:12. . I've lost 6lbs since Friday. That can't be good, can it? Mind you, I felt quite sprightly and nippy today, so maybe the old body is adapting to the constant instructions being given it?",3,-2
Lots of aspirations go out the window ! I have had a week off here and there in previous run-ups and been fine. If you have not done a mara before sub 4 is the big goal. Took me 6 goes to get it !,2,-2

BTW on the subject of awards (few pages back) I popped into work the other day with little Coxy Pip and was very suspicious when the management team appeared down in the coffee lounge where I was catching up with a friend and started gathering round us. Turned out was to present me with an award for outstanding contribution! Not bad eh whilst on maternity. Turns out was for something I did just before going off to have the little one. very chuffed! :) . Umbongo - I hope your chest is OK? Take it easy on your next run.

"thats good that 9mm feels easy. I remember doing a 12 mile MP run 2 weeks before my last marathon, I wouldnt have described it as easy, not hard either though, somewhere between if that makes sense. On race day I ended up averaging that pace so the fact that it felt easy is a very good sign. Just run 2 miles to and from the gym to do 30 mins at the gym. Legs could tell they had done something hard yesterday and HR was way higher than normal. Am not going to running club tommorrow night, instead I will do some very slow miles on my own",2,-2

Very negative and sweeping view I know, but I am more than a little sore still. Bear - do you remember the ice lolly at the top of Cocking Hill during Vrap's Trail Walk a few years back?

Don't forget you've been ill and the heat wouldn't have helped. Are you still doing Edinburgh? Remember I missed my super six target at the GNR but smashed it 3 weeks later. I really enjoyed most of my first marathon. Will write a report when i'm back home tomorrow night. I'm in agony now though. Quads are screaming, nasty blisters and i've done something to my left knee :-\",3,-3

Fantastic Captain - well done...and to you too AGT - cracking + attitude! I looked for CG at the start but the FGFA was a bit of a free for all. I lined up with two clubmates and they were 'supposedly' in different pens having different numbers to me... The toilet at teh FGFA made me laugh....the Geordie comic stating that it was def not a wet race as I was lined up with 30 or 40 blokes all p&pound;ssing up against a tarpaulin sheet... The organisation was spot on but one query...for those on red. Did anyone else think the first two mile markers were a little out? I was desp to keep hand brake on and sailed past mile 1 in 6.14?? and then at mile two I got taken by the RW 7.00mm train steaming past on the pavement and that was at 13.30 - ok 6.45 mm for them to get settled but they really stormed past in a hurry. Once red and blue mixed I pulled the reins and put less coal in the bucket. Not been able to log on to VFLM yet...are there details for the GFA process?,4,-2

Sub 3:30 or bust... You set up this inspirational forum and have to say (as a fellow spurs fan-well I'm guessing from the Cockrell!!) if you were up to 50 miles in May last year its there and depending on whereabouts in Scotland you might have quite a bit of running potential in them parts!! Thanks for getting this going as it helped spur me on (really no pun intended there!) with the others who joined in. A sub 4 is well within reach...as I know someone who only got back into running this year to finish in 4.30 and she had done nothing for years!! SO its possible. Good luck.,3,-1

"TR - got the sportive in the diary, should be good.",2,-1
"well i nearly had 2 weeks off.... went for a 5 miler and how slow was i.... i think i could walk faster than this pre marathon, how can you lose so much fitness in 2 weeks, it is scary... i am just gonna take it easy with 3-5 mile runs for the next few weeks with no consecutive days and no speedwork until seen physio - got my letter today, only been 2 days - who said NHS is slow. However on a positive note, i have entered the Silverstone half again next year - with my Dad. He does not run but has set it as his goal. He has a few stone to lose and had a heart bypass several years ago and a heart attack, but was so inspired by me completing the marathon that he is giving this a go - gonna start slowly with lots of walking and take it from there - that has got to be right up there with completing the marathon itself - to be able to influence somebody like that kind of leaves me a bit choked... i feel super super super proud. My sis is also gonna start in the next few days - so a right family affair happening here. :) :) :) .

Iraq was booted out of Kuwait by the US. It fought an 8 year war with Iran. All of it's weapons were purchased from the west. The US knew exactly what Saddam had.

This is why so many angry books by former intelligence agents.,1,-3

"Ehhhh... I think you're misusing corpus delicti. The corpus delicti is a test to determine if the crime being charged has actually occurred. For example, if we want to charge someone with murder, we have to show there has been a murder first. To do this we use the corpus delicti. You're trying to use it as a means of defining which actions are crimes. That's really outside the scope of what the corpus delicti is meant to do. I don't think any court has actually applied it this way.",1,-2
